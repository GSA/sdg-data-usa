The different wildlife products traded and seized are compared by applying an aggregation measure. Concepts: Wildlife is defined as protected wild species of flora and fauna which are legally traded and included in the CITES Appendices. With the exception of Appendix I species, most protected wildlife is legally traded. Poaching is defined as the illegal taking of wildlife for the purposes of international trade. Illicit trafficking is defined as illegal import or export of wildlife. Export Permits are required to export CITES-listed wildlife by every Member State (defined in Article VI of CITES, which regulates the information export permit shall contain and in Resolution Conf. 8.5, in which the Conference of the Parties to the Convention agreed on the information to be included in an export permitiv). Seizures are the result of confiscation of wildlife or wildlife products by national law enforcement authorities. Seizures occur when law enforcement authorities have suspicion that the wildlife or wildlife product they encounter is obtained or trafficked illegally. Depending on where, when and why national law enforcement authorities seize wildlife and wildlife products, the information about the seized items corresponds more or less to the variables defined by CITES in the export permit. A minimum prerequisite of a seizure report is naming the species (or lowest taxonomic level possible) of the seized specimen. Also the quantity of specimens and the unit of measure are ideally included, as well as the trade term defining the product that is seized. Aggregation measure. The weight and number of seizures cannot be used as an indicator of poaching, because it is meaningless to compare or add the different wildlife products. Since legal trade does occur among all species products, including those listed on CITES Appendix I, it is possible to derive standard prices from import records in a common market and to determine, for example, what the relative value of rosewood is as compared to dried seahorses.","indicator_name":"Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked","indicator_sort_order":"15-0c-01","indicator_variable":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"The indicator measures the law enforcement effort to combat poaching and illegal trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna, with seizures representing law enforcement action.

Illegal trade, however, is an indirect indicator of poaching. Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances of illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is unknown and variable. In addition, the number of species under international protection continues to grow. Legal international trade in protected species, by definition, is 100% captured in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Trade Database, which now contains over 16 million records of trade in CITES-listed species. To ground the illegal trade data in a complete indicator, the ratio of aggregated seizures to total trade is estimated. An increase in the share of total wildlife trade that is illegal would be interpreted as a negative indicator, and a decrease as a positive one.</p>\n<p>Because the illegal wildlife trade represents thousands of distinct products, a means of aggregation is necessary. The legal trade value does not represent the true black market value of the items seized, nor the true value of the legal shipments, because it is derived from a single market source (US LEMIS). It does, however, present a logical and consistent means of aggregating unlike products.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>- Seizures are an incomplete indicator of trafficking, and subject to considerable volatility, and depend on external factors that may not be directly linked to the volume of flows, such as law enforcement priorities. </p>\n<p>- Universal coverage is not presently available, although data are available for a growing number of countries (see section 5). </p>\n<p>- Since the indicator looks at the relationship between two values (legal vs illegal trade), changes in the relationship could be due to changes in either value.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The value of a species-product unit is derived from the median price declared for legal imports of analogous species product units, as acquired from United States Law Enforcement Monitoring and Information System of the Fish and Wildlife Service (US LEMIS).

Some additional sources (for cases where US LEMIS data were not available or were unreliable) were used, such as estimates based on field research from UNEP-WCMC and UNODC.
