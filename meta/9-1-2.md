  Rail passenger-kilometer data are Amtrak only.  Commuter rail, light rail and
  subways are included under transit.  Amtrak data are a sum of the
  passenger-kilometer data for the twelve months of each calendar year.  Air
  passenger-kilometer data are for certified air carriers in domestic service.

indicator_definition: >-
  Average parcel shipping time/parcel shipping time standards, by country, both
  for domestic and international parcel services, and by product: this is the
  level of reliability of domestic or international parcel delivery services and
  for different products exchanged between countries. This ratio is determined
  after dividing the average parcel shipping time by the standard shipping time
  expected for parcels delivery at the national or international level, and at
  the product level depending on data availability. An alternative way of
  computing a similar quality of service ratio would be to use the percentage of
  parcels actually delivered within the quality standard, i.e. within the
  standard for shipping times. The standard for shipping time is the expected
  end-to-end transit time and is often expressed as the posting day + one, two ,
  three, four or five days depending on the country geography and distance
  between countries.

  Data - https://www.bts.gov/faf
method_of_computation: >-
  Passenger data – number of passengers multiplied by the distance traveled.
  Freight data – the Freight Analysis Framework incorporates data from the 2012
  Commodity Flow Survey, Transborder Freight Data, Foreign Trade Statistics, and
  a combination of sources for individual sectors including agriculture, energy
  extraction, construction, and other sectors. Both passenger and freight data
  have been converted to metric units.

rationale_interpretation: >-
  With the strong development of national and international e-commerce, the
  quality of the postal and parcels delivery services is becoming a major
  concern for millions of enterprises and consumers transacting online. It is
  sometimes considered as a major hurdle by these market players and one of the
  challenges for trade facilitation, particularly for micro, small and
  medium-size enterprises interested in internationalizing their activities.
