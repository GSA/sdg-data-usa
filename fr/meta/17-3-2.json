Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by non-resident entities.

Even though many countries implemented direct reporting and dedicated models to estimate remittances flows, there are challenges in accurately measuring and compiling remittance data. Problems include, but are not limited to, countries&#x2019; adoption of heterogeneous concepts and definitions heterogeneously, deficiencies in coverage and scope, and discrepancies in gross/net recordings for components such as the compensation of employees. Accurate data on remittance flows is crucial for policymakers, governments, and international organizations to develop effective strategies for to promoting sustainable development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The accurate measurement and compilation of remittance data continue to pose challenges for several reasons. </p>\n<p>(i) Remittance transactions through unofficial channels: A significant portion of remittances flows through informal channels, such as cash hand-carried by migrants when they return home. These transactions are difficult to track and often go unrecorded in official statistics. Furthermore, digitalization through Fintech solutions have significantly impacted the remittance industry but are difficult to track. Data on mobile wallets that receive remittances as well as blockchain and cryptocurrencies to facilitate cross-border remittances have yet to be incorporated into countries&#x2019; data compilation frameworks. </p>\n<p>(ii) Inadequate adherence to the residency concept: With increasing numbers of refugees, including transit migrants (who do not establish permanent residency in their transit countries) as well as the new phenomenon of remote workers with dual residency status, further clarification and practical guidelines are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage. </p>\n<p>(iii) Misclassification: Classifications used for remittance statistics are often not in conformity with guidelines outlined in the IMF&#x2019;s Remittances Guide for Compilers or its Balance of Payments Manual (RCG/BPM6). Some non-remittance transactions, travel revenues and expenditures, or inward direct investment flows are often misclassified as inward remittances. And small trade payments, gifts to charitable organizations, or bank deposits are also sometimes misclassified as personal remittances, further complicating data accuracy.</p>\n<p>(iv) Incompatibility of source data: There are several key limitations in the source data, including its lack of comprehensiveness, susceptibility to country-specific conditions, and incompleteness for proper transaction classification according to defined criteria in terms of scope, classifications, valuation, and required timing of recording.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Personal remittances are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF&apos;s Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees.
