In recent years, some countries conducting Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) have included the standard, or an adapted, version of the DHS module. Respondents are asked whether, at any time in their lives (as children or adults), anyone ever forced them &#x2013; physically or in any other way &#x2013; to have sexual intercourse or to perform any other sexual acts against their will.

This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the national population level; data are collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates for the indicator. </p>\n<p>As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government authorities on 10 of the child-related SDG indicators in its role of sole or joint custodian, and in line with its global monitoring mandate and normative commitments to advancing the 2030 Agenda for children.
