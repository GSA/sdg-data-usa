In the US, several national laws providing this coverage are relevant. For coding purposes, we consider three most relevant: the Paperwork Reduction Act, which gives authority to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to designate a Chief Statistician with professional credentials and to designate the responsibility of ensuring official national statistics reflect relevance, accuracy, and objectivity.
