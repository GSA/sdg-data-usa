Physician information, including non-federal doctors of medicine (M.D.) and doctors of osteopath (D.O.), is from the American Medical Association Physician Master file. Physician assistant and advanced practice registered nurse (including, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and advance practice nurse midwife) data are from the Centers from Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) National Provider Identification (NPI) File. The Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) mandated the adoption of standard unique identifiers for health care providers and health plans. The NPI is a unique identifier developed by CMS. Covered health care providers and all health plans and health care clearinghouses must use the NPIs in the administrative and financial transactions adopted under HIPAA.

The estimated population is calculated from a components of change model that incorporates information on natural change (births, deaths) and net migration (net internal migration, net international migration) that has occurred in an area since a Census 2010 reference date for 2011-2016 estimates.  Metro/non-metro classification is from Census Bureau and defined based on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2017 delineation of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area. The 2017 updates are based on the applications of the 2010 Standards for Delineating the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical areas to Census population estimate for July 2014 and July 2015.","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_show_map":false,"source_active_2":false,"disaggregation_categories":"NA","international_and_national_references":"NA","time_period":"2010-2016","source_notes_1":"Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) incorporates several data sources at the aggregated level, including health workers data, population data, and geographic data.","page_content":""}
