Total primary energy supply, as defined by the IEA, is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.","indicator_name":"Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP","indicator_variable":"tot_prm_eny_con_dol_gdp","method_of_computation":"Calculated as energy consumption divided by U.S. gross domestic product in chained (2009) dollars","periodicity":"Annual provided, monthly data also available","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. It is a proxy of the efficiency with which an economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.","reporting_status":"complete","scheduled_update_by_national_source":"Monthly ","source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"maggie.woodward@eia.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"Maggie Woodward","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"Energy Information Agency","source_organisation_1":"Energy Information Agency","source_url_1":"http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/","source_url_text_1":"http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/","target":"By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.","target_id":"7.3","time_period":"1949-2018 available","title":"Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP","un_custodial_agency":"UNSD, IEA (Partnering Agencies: World Bank, UN Energy)","un_designated_tier":"1","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_show_map":false,"source_active_2":false,"page_content":""}
