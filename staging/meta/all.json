It is not a composite indicator, but a logical linkage of laws and policies to practical impact that is relevant to SDG concerns. \nThe practical guarantee of public access may be partially assessed through dimensions such as those unpacked by The World Bank. In this way, the practical quality of legal provisions can be established by identifying if there are: 1) proactive disclosure provisions in laws that establish a legal duty to disclose; 2) mechanisms for citizens, firms, and others to request information that has not been proactively disclosed but that is relevant to their interests, 3) narrowly-tailored guidelines on exemptions to disclosure, and 4) institutional structures that support disclosure, such as information commissioners, oversight mechanisms, and complaints mechanisms. In some national cases, there is also information on the sources and numbers of requests and the response time taken to process these requests. \nUNESCO, within its mandate for the right to freedom of expression, which includes the corollary of the right to freedom of information, already monitors progress and issues in this area through its existing submissions to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and regularly issued research reports on World Trends on Freedom of Expression and Media Development, including its Media Development Indicators assessments. Collaboration with the World Bank is foreseen, as well as drawing upon work undertaken by ARTICLE 19 in this area. \nAll these will be considered important aspects of establishing the existence and implementation of constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":16,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.","target_id":"16.1","title":"Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information","un_custodial_agency":"UNESCO-UIS  (Partnering Agencies:World Bank, UNEP)","un_designated_tier":"2","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"17-2-1":{"actual_indicator_available":null,"actual_indicator_available_description":null,"comments_and_limitations":null,"computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":true,"date_metadata_updated":null,"date_of_national_source_publication":null,"disaggregation_categories":null,"disaggregation_geography":null,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf","graph_title":"Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors' gross national income (GNI)","graph_type":null,"has_metadata":true,"indicator":"17.2.1","indicator_definition":"Net official development assistance (ODA;http://www.oecd.org/dac/dac-glossary.htm#ODA) to all countries on the DAC List of ODA Recipients (http://www.oecd.org/dac/dac-glossary.htm#DAC_List) and net official development assistance to the Least Developed Countries, SIDS and LLDCs (http://unohrlls.org/), as well as African countries.

It takes into account the different water sources as well as various users and uses in a given situation, with the aim of maximizing positive social, economic and environmental benefits. It uses catchments and aquifers, as the principle unit of water management, and stresses decentralization of governance structures and active stakeholder participation in decision making. Transboundary basins are surface water or groundwater basins (aquifers) which cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States. An agreement, institutional arrangement and/or an established organization provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Such a framework is commonly based on an agreement covering different aspects of transboundary water management. Agreements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial or interagency. In addition to an agreement (e.g. a treaty, convention, Memorandum of Understanding), such framework can be provided by a bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation. Furthermore, multi-sectoral cooperation institutions can cover for water issues. For a cooperation framework to be considered as \"operational\", it requires that there are regular meetings of the riparian countries to discuss the integrated management of the water resource and to exchange information.","indicator_name":"Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation","indicator_sort_order":"06-05-02","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"Calculated ' for any spatial unit (country, region) ' as the percentage that the total surface area (in km2) of transboundary basins that have an operational arrangement for water cooperation makes up of the total surface area of transboundary basins (km2).

Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Directly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate \"directly affected\" as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of \"directly affected\", or those who are \tInjured or ill, \tEvacuated, \tRelocated and to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \tPeople who received food relief aid. Injured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. Evacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. Relocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. People whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. Houses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. Houses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. People who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities.). Note: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.","indicator_name":"Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","indicator_variable":"disaster_rsk_rdctn","method_of_computation":"Summation of data on related indicators from national disaster loss databases. Make the sum a relative figure by using global population data (World Bank or UN Statistics information). Relativity is important because population growth (expected to be 9 billion in 2050) may translate into increased hazard exposure of population. The Expert Group recommends not using the indicators related with the people whose houses were damaged/destroyed in the computation. UNISDR and IRDR groups recommend using them as they can be estimated from widely available and verifiable data and reflect vulnerability and livelihood issues. Data on housing damage and destroyed is essential for economic loss, so using these indicators would not impose additional data collection burden. Double-counting: From practical perspective, double counting of affected people is unavoidable (for example, injured and relocated) in many countries. Minimum double counting is summing 'number of injured' and Number of people whose housings were damaged or destroyed. Relocated is sub-set of number of people whose housings were destroyed. The data can be disaggregated by hazard type. When applied to proposed target 13.1 and 15.3, hydrological, meteorological and climatological and indirectly biological disasters are monitored.","periodicity":"Annual","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. Human loss can be measured by the number of deaths, missing, injured or ill, evacuated, relocated, people whose houses were damaged/destroyed and people who received food relief aid as a direct result of the hazardous events.\n Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them.\n Biodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas.\n This indicator will track human-related loss. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events.\n The indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of human related loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism.","reporting_status":"complete","source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_name_1":"OMB (formerly Amy Rosenband, NSC)","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_organisation_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_url_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","source_url_text_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","target":"By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.","target_id":"1.5","title":"Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","un_custodial_agency":"UNISDR (Partnering Agencies: WMO, UNFCCC, UNEP)","un_designated_tier":"2","us_method_of_computation":"US Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness, including the National Preparedness Goal and the National Preparedness System\u200b","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_show_map":false,"source_active_2":false,"page_content":""},"3-8-2":{"data_non_statistical":true,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-3.pdf","graph_title":"Proportion of population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income","graph_type":null,"has_metadata":false,"indicator":"3.8.2","indicator_name":"Proportion of population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income","indicator_sort_order":"03-08-02","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/3-8-2/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":3,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.","target_id":"3.8","title":"Proportion of population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income","un_custodial_agency":"WHO (Partnering Agencies: World Bank)","un_designated_tier":"2","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"14-6-1":{"data_non_statistical":true,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-14.pdf","graph_title":"Progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing","graph_type":null,"has_metadata":true,"indicator":"14.6.1","indicator_definition":"The indicator \"Productivity of aquaculture in utilizing natural resources (land, water and wild stock)\"is to provide for a measure the of the productivity of the aquaculture production process, and is defined as the value and volume of aquaculture production per unit amount of natural resource utilized in the aquaculture production process.

The risk class is considered to be \"unknown\" if (i) no population sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of calculation (10 year cut off point). Links to official definitions/descriptions of the indicator are reported below: The indicator is one out of a set of 3 sub-indicators which are defined in the document CGRFA/WG-AnGR-7/12/7 \"Targets and indicators for animal genetic resources\" (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me514e.pdf) and that are endorsed in their current form by Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its the 14th Session (see par 28 CRRFA-14/13/Report at http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf). The indicator serves to monitor the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources. In this respect the indicator is presented in the \"Status and Trends of Animal Genetic Rescources-2014\" (see http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm278e.pdf). This indicator is also proposed for the Target 15.5 under SDG, and it serves also as an indicator for the Aichi Target 13 \"Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated Animals\" under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It is described on the webpage of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP), a network of organizations which have come together to provide the most up-to date biodiversity information possible for tracking progress towards the Aichi Targets (http://www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals). Further, it is presented in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, page 91 (see http://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4-en-lr.pdf) which is an output of the processes under the CBD. Risk classes are defined as follows: \textinct: a breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females remaining. Nevertheless, genetic material might have been cryo-conserved which would allow recreation of the breed. In reality, extinction may be realized well before the loss of the last animal or genetic material. \tcritical: a breed is categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is less than or equal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five; or the overall population size is less than or equal to 120 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not classified as extinct. \tcritical-maintained: are those critical populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions. \tendangered: a breed is categorized as endangered if the total number of breeding females is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1 000 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to 20 and greater than five; or the overall population size is greater than 80 and less than 100 and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is above 80 percent; or the overall population size is greater than 1 000 and less than or equal to 1 200 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not assigned to any of above categories. \tendangered-maintained: are those endangered populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions. \tbreed at risk: a breed that has been classified as either critical, critical-maintained, endangered, or endangered-maintained.","indicator_name":"Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction","indicator_sort_order":"02-05-02","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/2-5-2/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":2,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and ensure access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed","target_id":"2.5","title":"Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction","un_custodial_agency":"FAO (Partnering Agencies: UNEP)","un_designated_tier":"1","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"17-18-3":{"graph_type":"binary","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","has_metadata":true,"indicator_sort_order":"17-18-03","indicator":"17.18.3","variable_notes":null,"variable_description":null,"layout":"indicator","permalink":"/17-18-3/","sdg_goal":17,"actual_indicator_available":"Existence of Funded and Implemented National Statistical Program ","comments_and_limitations":"Programs are fully funded and fully implemented to the extent described in the Annual Report.

Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, can include for example agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and municipalities. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity. The indicator builds on MDG indicator 7.5 and also accounts for environmental water requirements.This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country's renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms \"water resources\" and \"water withdrawal\" are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. External renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties (and, where available, the reduction of flow due to upstream withdrawal). Total freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater) and fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and use of desalinated water. Environmental water requirements (Env.) are established in order to protect the basic environmental services of freshwater ecosystems. Methods of computation of Env. are extremely variable. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, Env. are expressed as a percentage of the available water resources. More details on method of calculation of the above variables can be found at http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm or http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/wrs/readPdf.html?f=AFG-WRS_eng.pdf.","indicator_name":"Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources","indicator_sort_order":"06-04-02","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (TWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental water requirements (Env.), multiplied by 100.

Stress (%) = ( TWW / TRWR - Env. ) * 100 It is proposed to classify the level of water stress in three main categories (levels): low, high and very high. The thresholds for the indicator could be country specific, to reflect differences in climate and national water management objectives.

It can also indicate the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":6,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.","target_id":"6.4","title":"Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources","un_custodial_agency":"FAO (Partnering Agencies: UNEP, IUCN, UNSD, OECD, Eurostat)","un_designated_tier":"1","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"13-1-3":{"computation_units":"Yes/No","data_non_statistical":false,"date_metadata_updated":"February 2018 (Kali Kong)","goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-13.pdf","graph_title":"Has the US established national and local disaster risk reduction strategies?","graph_type":"binary","has_metadata":false,"indicator":"13.1.3","indicator_name":"Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies","indicator_sort_order":"13-01-03","indicator_variable":"disaster_rsk_rdctn","layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","periodicity":"Annual","permalink":"/13-1-3/","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":13,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"Elan_P_Strait@nsc.eop.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"Elan Strait","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","source_url_text_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","target":"Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.","target_id":"13.1","title":"Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies","un_designated_tier":"2","us_method_of_computation":"US Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness, including the National Preparedness Goal and the National Preparedness System","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"3-3-3":{"graph_type":"binary","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","has_metadata":true,"indicator_sort_order":"03-03-03","indicator":"3.3.3","variable_notes":null,"variable_description":null,"layout":"indicator","permalink":"/3-3-3/","sdg_goal":3,"comments_and_limitations":"The US CDC is not able to report.

routine, organization, and ability to follow classroom rules. Possible scores on the approaches to learning scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibits positive learning behaviors more often. The interpersonal skills scale is based on teachers' reports on the student\u2019s skill in forming and maintaining friendships; getting along with people who are different; comforting or helping other children; expressing feelings, ideas, and opinions in positive ways; and showing sensitivity to the feelings of others. Possible scores on the interpersonal skills scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child interacted with others in a positive way more often. The self-control scale is based on teachers' reports on the student\u2019s ability to control behavior by respecting the property rights of others, controlling temper, accepting peer ideas for group activities, and responding appropriately to pressure from peers. Possible scores on the self-control scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibited behaviors indicative of self-control more often. Reading score reflects performance on questions measuring basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming words, and word recognition); vocabulary knowledge; and reading comprehension, including identifying information specifically stated in text (e.g., definitions, facts, and supporting details), making complex inferences from texts, and considering the text objectively and judging its appropriateness and quality. Possible scores for the reading assessment range from 0 to 120. Mathematics score reflects performance on questions on number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability (measured with a set of simple questions assessing children\u2019s ability to read a graph); and prealgebra skills such as identification of patterns.

Enforced disappearance is defined as the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law (International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, adapted to account for disappearances perpetrated by non-State actors). Arbitrary detention is detention without due process and safeguards, as outlined in Article 9(1) ICCPR. Torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (Convention against Torture). Assault means physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury. Human rights defenders is a term used to describe people who, individually or with others, act to promote or protect human rights. Human rights defenders are identified above all by what they do and it is through a description of their actions and of some of the contexts in which they work that the term can best be explained. The definition of human rights defenders may include journalists and trade unionists, but each individual case is counted only once. Other examples may include a student campaigning to end torture in prisons, a politician who takes a stand against endemic corruption or witnesses in court cases on human rights abuses. Journalists cover 'journalists, media workers and social media producers who generate a significant amount of public-interest journalism.'

In a broader sense, conflict-related deaths also include killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military 'hors combat'. The rates are defined as the total count of intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, respectively, divided by the total resident population, expressed per 100,000 population. From United Nations Mine Action Service:  The count of conflict-related deaths caused by mines/ERW should include \"individuals killed or injured in incidents involving devices detonated by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person or a vehicle, such as all antipersonnel mines, antivehicle mines, abandoned explosive ordnance (AXO), unexploded ordnance (UXO), and victim-activated IEDs.\"","indicator_name":"Conflict-related deaths per 100,000 population, by sex, age and cause","indicator_sort_order":"16-01-02","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/16-1-2/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nThese indicators refer to two forms of violent deaths (intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths). Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries afflicted by wars. \nThe rates of intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths should be kept separate, as combining them into one single indicator would risk collating two distinct phenomena and unequal sources of data. In particular, the quality of data on conflictrelated deaths is inevitably affected by the difficulties of producing accurate statistics in situations of armed conflict. \nMonitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability. \nConflict-related deaths measure the direct impact of conflicts on populations in terms of losses of life. Whilst the global risk of violent death in armed conflict is generally lower than the global risk of homicidal violence, in affected countries armed conflict destroys lives and exerts substantial human costs, particularly in protracted internal conflict situations.\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n The presence of mines/ERW in conflict and post-conflict contexts is devastating for people and communities. These hazards cause grievous injury and death, impede peace operations, and hamper post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts. \nFindings from the M&E Mechanism for the UN Strategy 2013-2018 (UN M&E Mechanism) illustrate the deadly risk posed by mines/ERW in affected countries and territories in which the UN operates; in particular, the disproportionate impact of explosive hazards on the civilians who constitute more than half of the casualties from mines/ERW. The regular monitoring of mine/ERW casualty data through the global mechanism of the Sustainable Development Goals will significantly enhance the capacity of affected countries and territories including Member States, UN entities, and civil society to understand the scope of these threats and effectively mitigate the harms they cause.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":16,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere.","target_id":"16.1","title":"Conflict-related deaths per 100,000 population, by sex, age and cause","un_custodial_agency":"OHCHR  (Partnering Agencies:UNMAS, DESA-Population Division)","un_designated_tier":"3","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"7-b-1":{"actual_indicator_available":null,"actual_indicator_available_description":null,"comments_and_limitations":null,"computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":true,"date_metadata_updated":null,"date_of_national_source_publication":null,"disaggregation_categories":null,"disaggregation_geography":null,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-7.pdf","graph_title":"Investments in energy efficiency as a proportion of GDP and the amount of foreign direct investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and technology to sustainable development services","graph_type":null,"has_metadata":false,"indicator":"7.b.1","indicator_definition":"","indicator_name":"Investments in energy efficiency as a proportion of GDP and the amount of foreign direct investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and technology to sustainable development services","indicator_sort_order":"07-0b-01","indicator_variable":null,"international_and_national_references":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","periodicity":null,"permalink":"/7-b-1/","published":false,"rationale_interpretation":"","reporting_status":"notstarted","scheduled_update_by_SDG_team":null,"scheduled_update_by_national_source":null,"sdg_goal":7,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":null,"source_agency_staff_name_1":null,"source_agency_survey_dataset_1":null,"source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":null,"target":"By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries and small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support","target_id":"7.b","time_period":null,"title":"Investments in energy efficiency as a proportion of GDP and the amount of foreign direct investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and technology to sustainable development services","un_custodial_agency":"IEA","un_designated_tier":"3","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"9-5-1":{"graph_type":"line","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","has_metadata":true,"indicator_sort_order":"09-05-01","indicator":"9.5.1","variable_notes":null,"variable_description":null,"layout":"indicator","permalink":"/9-5-1/","sdg_goal":9,"actual_indicator_available":"Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP","actual_indicator_available_description":"As stated","comments_and_limitations":"This indicator is widely used around the world as a comparative metric for national R&D intensity","computation_units":"percent","data_non_statistical":false,"date_metadata_updated":"May 14, 2019","date_of_national_source_publication":"Latest data is October 2018","disaggregation_categories":"Some disaggregation of the indicator is available by R&D performers and sources of R&D funding.","disaggregation_geography":"Some disaggregation of the indicator by U.S. geographic regions (mainly, states) is available.","goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-9.pdf","graph_title":"US research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP","indicator_definition":"The OECD Frascati Manual provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers.

The different wildlife products traded and seized are compared by applying an aggregation measure. Concepts: Wildlife is defined as protected wild species of flora and fauna which are legally traded and included in the CITES Appendices. With the exception of Appendix I species, most protected wildlife is legally traded. Poaching is defined as the illegal taking of wildlife for the purposes of international trade. Illicit trafficking is defined as illegal import or export of wildlife. Export Permits are required to export CITES-listed wildlife by every Member State (defined in Article VI of CITES, which regulates the information export permit shall contain and in Resolution Conf. 8.5, in which the Conference of the Parties to the Convention agreed on the information to be included in an export permitiv). Seizures are the result of confiscation of wildlife or wildlife products by national law enforcement authorities. Seizures occur when law enforcement authorities have suspicion that the wildlife or wildlife product they encounter is obtained or trafficked illegally. Depending on where, when and why national law enforcement authorities seize wildlife and wildlife products, the information about the seized items corresponds more or less to the variables defined by CITES in the export permit. A minimum prerequisite of a seizure report is naming the species (or lowest taxonomic level possible) of the seized specimen. Also the quantity of specimens and the unit of measure are ideally included, as well as the trade term defining the product that is seized. Aggregation measure. The weight and number of seizures cannot be used as an indicator of poaching, because it is meaningless to compare or add the different wildlife products. Since legal trade does occur among all species products, including those listed on CITES Appendix I, it is possible to derive standard prices from import records in a common market and to determine, for example, what the relative value of rosewood is as compared to dried seahorses.","indicator_name":"Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked","indicator_sort_order":"15-0c-01","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/15-c-1/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"The indicator measures the law enforcement effort to combat poaching and illegal trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna, with seizures representing law enforcement action.

For example if the purpose is to estimate national transmission of HBV (including mother_to_child transmission) then the sampling should be geographically representative of the population. Convenience sampling is not appropriate. The sample size should be adequate to show with 95% confidence HBsAg prevalence of less than 1% with a precision of ' 0.5%. The target age is 5_years_old. Sampling 4 ' 6 year olds may be appropriate. The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point estimate time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred. Data on HBV birth dose exposure and B3 completion are drawn from official records. Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for the serosurvey. This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be done in addition. Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate to minimize bias though specimen degradation in rural and remote areas. Where possible, it is advantageous to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory testing because the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is higher than for rapid tests. However in some locations only rapid tests will be available hence test selection is resource dependent. This should be considered in designing overall study methodology.

It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Directly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate \"directly affected\" as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of \"directly affected\", or those who are \tInjured or ill, \tEvacuated, \tRelocated and to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \tPeople who received food relief aid. Injured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. Evacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. Relocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. People whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. Houses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. Houses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. People who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reductio","indicator_name":"Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030","indicator_variable":"disaster_rsk_rdctn","method_of_computation":"Summation of data on related indicators from national disaster loss databases. Make the sum a relative figure by using global population data (World Bank or UN Statistics information). Relativity is important because population growth (expected to be 9 billion in 2050) may translate into increased hazard exposure of population. The Expert Group recommends not using the indicators related with the people whose houses were damaged/destroyed in the computation. UNISDR and IRDR groups recommend using them as they can be estimated from widely available and verifiable data and reflect vulnerability and livelihood issues. Data on housing damage and destroyed is essential for economic loss, so using these indicators would not impose additional data collection burden. Double-counting: From practical perspective, double counting of affected people is unavoidable (for example, injured and relocated) in many countries. Minimum double counting is summing \"number of injured\" and Number of people whose housings were damaged or destroyed. Relocated is sub-set of number of people whose housings were destroyed. The data can be disaggregated by hazard type. When applied to proposed target 13.1 and 15.3, hydrological, meteorological and climatological and indirectly biological disasters are monitored.","periodicity":"Annual","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. Human loss can be measured by the number of deaths, missing, injured or ill, evacuated, relocated, people whose houses were damaged/destroyed and people who received food relief aid as a direct result of the hazardous events. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. \nBiodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track human-related loss. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. \nThe indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of human related loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism.

Agricultural value added in national currency is obtained from national statistics, converted to USD and deflated to the baseline year 2015. The Cr coefficient can be estimated as Cr= 37%, on the basis of the general FAO assumption on the ratio between rainfed and irrigated yield. More detailed estimations are however possible and encouraged at country level. Water efficiency of industries is calculated as the industrial value added per unit of industrial (net) water withdrawn, and expressed in USD/m3. In formula: Iwe = GVAiVi-Ri Where: \tIwe = Irrigated water efficiency [USD/m3] \tGVAi = Gross value added by industry (excluding energy)[USD] \tVi =  Volume of water withdrawn by the industries (excluding energy) [m3] \tRi = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3]  Industrial water withdrawal (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Industrial value added is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year 2015. Energy (power) water efficiency is calculated as the value added of power production per unit of (net) water withdrawn for energy production, and expressed in MWh/m3. In formula: Ewe = TEPVe-Re Where: \tEwe = Energy water efficiency [MWh/m3] \tTEP = Total energy production [MWh] \tVe =  Volume of water withdrawn for energy production, i.e. for the cooling of power plants (including evaporation from reservoirs created behind dams for hydropower) [m3] \tRe = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3]  Volume of water withdrawn for energy production (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Value added of electricity production is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year 2015. Municipal water supply efficiency is the ratio between water effectively distributed to the municipal users and the water withdrawn for municipal use by water supply utilities (i.e. distribution efficiency, size of network losses).

There is also a large body of literature documenting the adverse health consequences of FGM/C over both the short and long term. FGM/C is condemned by a number of international treaties and conventions including the Universal Declaration of Human Right (Article 25). FGM/C can also be considered as a form of violence against women, and therefore the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women can be invoked. Similarly, defining it as a form of torture brings it under the rubric of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Moreover, since FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include explicit bans against FGM/C. \n\nFrom WHO: \n Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve the partial or total removal of external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons [1].

WHO air quality guidelines provide specific recommendations on the mean levels of fine particulate matter which can support measuring the per capita health impacts related to any improvements or degradation in air quality in cities. Incidents of high air pollution levels also have health impacts, but these are less important than longer term exposures, and related statistics are less reliable in view of greater variability due to external factors, we therefore do recommend a more specific articulation of this indicator to as annual means as a way to monitor SDG achievement. \nFine particulate matter: Fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) can be directly linked to estimates of health risks. Coarse particulate matter (i.e. PM10) measurements can be converted to PM2.5, but will inherently introduce additional uncertainty to estimates of impacts (e.g. health).

By defining sustainability across its three dimensions, countries can select those metrics within their measurement instrument that best capture the priorities most relevant to them.\n A set of possible metrics for each sustainability dimension will be established in order to ensure relevance across the whole range of possible socio-economic and bio-physical conditions. Farm surveys will be designed on the basis of a limited set of these measurements, established at national level in order to cover the most relevant aspects of these three dimensions of sustainability. Each surveyed farm will be assessed against targets for each of these measurements, decided at national level.

Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed. The civilian labor force comprises all persons classified as employed or unemployed. The CPS uses a set of six questions to identify persons with disabilities. In the CPS, persons are classified as having a disability if there is a response of \"\"yes\"\" to any of these questions: 1.\tIs anyone deaf or does anyone have serious difficulty hearing? 2.\tIs anyone blind or does anyone have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses? 3.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does anyone have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions? 4.\tDoes anyone have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? 5.\tDoes anyone have difficulty dressing or bathing? 6.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does anyone have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping?","comments_and_limitations":"The questions noted above were added to the CPS in June 2008 to identify persons with a  disability in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and older. The collection of these data is sponsored by the Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy. Statistics based on the CPS are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The component of this difference that occurs because samples differ by chance is known as sampling error, and its variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling error. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence.  The CPS data also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the population,  inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, and errors made in the collection or processing of the data.  Additional information about the reliability of data from the CPS and estimating standard errors is available at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability. CPS estimates are controlled to population totals that are available by age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. These controls are developed by the Census Bureau and are based on complete population counts obtained in the decennial census. In the years between decennial censuses, they incorporate the latest information about population change (births, deaths, and net international migration). As part of its annual update of population estimates, the Census Bureau introduces adjustments to the total population controls. The updated controls typically have a negligible impact on unemployment rates and other ratios. The estimates of the population of persons with a disability are not controlled to independent population totals of persons with a disability because such data are not available.

(Resolution A/RES/62/98) An \"index of sustainable forest management\" with four sub-indicators can be used as a basic indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management by a country. The four sub-indicators are \t1. Annual average percent change in forest area over most recent available 5 year period \t2. Annual average percent change in stock of carbon in above ground biomass over most recent available 5 year period \t3. Share of forest area whose primary designated function is biodiversity conservation, most recent period \t4. Share of forest area under a forest management plan, of which forest area certified under an independent forest management certification scheme, most recent period For each of these components, countries can set national targets, monitor and report on progress. The four sub-indicators will be combined into a single composite index, but targets would be set at the level of sub-indicators. Once targets have been set by national authorities, in terms of the four sub-indicators, and progress measured over an agreed period, countries would assess progress (on track to exceed target, on track to achieve target, progress but at an insufficient rate, no significant overall progress, moving away from target). The final value of the index would be a simple arithmetic average of the values for the four sub-indicators. The use of national targets allows each country to define sustainable forest management for its own specific circumstances, within a coherent international framework. Targets on the sub-indicators can also be set at regional or global levels.","indicator_name":"Progress towards sustainable forest management","indicator_sort_order":"15-02-01","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/15-2-1/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"The definition of SFM by UN GA contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances ' ecological, social and economic ' vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. \nClearly a simple measure of change in forest area, while essential, and used for target 15.1, is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a whole. The index proposed combines the two indicators at present under consideration (\"forest loss\" and \"area certified\") with measures of use/degradation (sub-indicator 2), biodiversity conservation (sub-indicator 3) to give a more rounded picture of sustainable forest management. Further \"topical\" sub-indicators will be needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of SFM aspects. The significance of the four sub-indicators may be briefly explained as follows: \n\t1. Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM: clearly, if there is significant uncontrolled deforestation, forest management is not sustainable. The indicator focuses on change as there is no ideal share of forest in land cover, as the share is determined by history, ecological circumstances and competing land uses. The indicator covers the net effect of the other parts of Target 15.2: \"halt deforestation\" and \"substantially increase afforestation and reforestation\". However most countries have reliable data on the components of this overall trend (deforestation, afforestation and reforestation), for which separate targets can be specified, if so desired. This component incorporates the concept of \"net permanent forest loss \" at present classified \"green\" and is also used for Target 15.1 \n\t2. Changes in the stock of biomass are determined by the balance between increase in volume of wood biomass (annual increment) and decrease (natural losses and damage by fire insects etc., and wood harvest). In a sustainably managed forest, increment is more than losses, so that the biomass stock increases, or does not decrease, and carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere. With very few exceptions, a decline in total biomass stocks, even if the forest area does not decrease, implies unsustainable management (and possible degradation). As the wood/carbon ratio is constant, there will be exactly the same trends for carbon stocks as for wood biomass. Therefore a single indicator addresses carbon stocks and flows and trends in growing stock of wood, and may be expressed in m3 of wood or in tons of carbon. \n\t3. Forest areas managed for the conservation of biodiversity are a proxy for trends in forest biodiversity and a clear indication of political will to incorporate biodiversity into forest management. The CBD Aichi Target 11 calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, so this may be taken as a goal for this element. Work is in hand on developing a number of indicators of forest biodiversity, which may be useful in the future. \n\t4. The fourth parameter looks at the area within a country where a key tool for sustainable forest management is applied. The existence of a \"forest management plan\" is a necessary tool for evidence based, long term management. Those areas that are certified by third party schemes as being sustainably managed work on the basis of an independently verified management plan. While the latter fulfils a higher standard, it should be pointed out that there are very significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no credible (or affordable) certification scheme is in place for that area. The latter is true for most tropical countries. For this reason, using \"area of certified forest\" as the sole indicator could give a misleading impression.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":15,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.","target_id":"15.2","title":"Progress towards sustainable forest management","un_custodial_agency":"FAO  (Partnering Agencies: UNEP, UNFCCC)","un_designated_tier":"1","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"11-b-1":{"computation_units":"Yes/No","data_non_statistical":false,"date_metadata_updated":"February, 2018 (Kali Kong)","goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-11.pdf","graph_title":"Has the US established national and local disaster risk reduction strategies?","graph_type":"binary","has_metadata":true,"indicator":"11.b.1","indicator_definition":"Local DRR Strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030: local disaster risk reduction strategies and plans, across different timescales with targets, indicators and time frames, aimed at preventing the creation of risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience (Sendai Framework, para27 (b)).

Increasing resilience of cities is critical to reduce disaster risk and achieve sustainable development. Cities are also very vulnerable to natural disasters, especially climate-related shocks. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 megacities lie in coastal flood zones. Coastal cities are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. In addition to the impact on communities and non-human species, the unplanned urbanization also undermines the ecosystem services that support much hard urban infrastructure. This type of development also exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts, including hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. \nLocated mostly in cities where disadvantaged groups are situated and when affordable access is addressed, resilient infrastructures such as health, education, road and other critical infrastructures will have direct impact on reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive and sustainable. \nThe opportunity is that 60% of the area expected to be urban by 2030 remains to be built, indicating that the shape of future cities can be proactively guided into more risk-sensitive development.

In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of \"Forest\" and \"Total Land Area\". According to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as \"land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use\". More specifically: \tForest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. \tIt includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used. \tIt includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest. \tIt includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters. \tIt includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters. \tIt includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not. \tIt includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. \tIt includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met. \tIt excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the \"Taungya\" system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.

Access to family planning provides women and their partners opportunities to make decisions about family size and timing of pregnancies. This contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Unmet need for family planning shows the gap between women's reproductive intentions and their access to or use of contraceptives. The CPR provides an estimate of contraceptive use in a population. Both the unmet need for family planning and CPR indicators are used for tracking progress towards the MDG 5 target 5B of achieving universal access to reproductive health.\" (WHO, 2011)\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n The contraceptive prevalence rate, which serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services, is useful for tracking progress towards the target of achieving universal access to reproductive health, especially when the indicator is considered in conjunction with information about women's knowledge of family planning or accessibility, and the quality of family planning services. Information on contraceptive prevalence complements the indicator of unmet need for family planning. The sum of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need determines the total demand for contraception. Unlike the unmet need indicator, contraceptive prevalence does not take into account whether women or couples do or do not desire additional children. This makes the indicator more difficult to interpret than unmet need because contraceptive prevalence rates vary across societies with vastly different preferred family sizes. For the same reason, it is difficult to specify the desired target for contraceptive prevalence rates.","reporting_status":"complete","source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"ambranum@cdc.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"National Survey of Family Growth, Reproductive Statistics Branch, Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"National Center for Health Statistics/National Survey of Family Growth","source_organisation_1":"National Center for Health Statistics/National Survey of Family Growth","source_url_1":"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2011_2013_puf.htm","source_url_text_1":"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2011_2013_puf.htm","target":"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.","target_id":"3.7","time_period":"2002-2016","title":"Proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods","un_custodial_agency":"DESA Population Division (Partnering Agencies: UNFPA, WHO)","un_designated_tier":"1","us_method_of_computation":"Measures the contraceptive method used (if any) in the month of the interview (not at a specific act of sexual intercourse) among female participants aged 15-44 in the National Survey of Family Growth.

Public spaces encompass a range of environments including streets, sidewalks squares, gardens, parks, conservation areas. Each public space has its own spatial, historic, environmental, social and economic features. They can be publically or privately managed.  Public Space: Having sufficient public space allows cities and regions to function efficiently and equitably. Reduced amounts of public space impact negatively on quality of life, social inclusion, infrastructure development, environmental sustainable and productivity. It is documented that well designed and maintained streets and public spaces result in lower crime and violence. Making space for formal and informal economic activities, recovering and maintaining public spaces for a diversity of users in a positive way, and making services and opportunities available to marginalized residents, enhance social cohesion and economic security. Uncontrolled rapid urbanization generally creates settlement patterns with dangerously low proportions of public space. As a result, these places are unable to accommodate safe pedestrian and vehicular rights of way, land for critical infrastructure like water, sewerage and waste collection, recreational spaces, green areas and parks that contribute to social cohesion and protected ecological hotspots and corridors. As new cities also develop they have reduced allocations of land for public space especially streets. On average, at 15% the land allocated to streets in new planned areas is substantially less than the standard and in unplanned areas the situation is considerably worse with an average of 2%. The generally accepted minimum standard for public space in higher density settlements (150 inhabitants or more per/hectare) is 45% (30% for streets and sidewalks and 15% for open public space).Total city space refers to the built-up area of the city. The proportion of urban areas dedicated to streets and public spaces is a crucial feature of the spatial plans of cities. The road network is the integrative and dynamic factor between individuals and socioeconomic activities. It is a structuring component of geographic space and defines the socio-dynamics of an area being conditioned by the spatial pattern, which restricts the location of roads and human settlements. Short and direct pedestrian and cycling routes require highly connected network of paths and streets around small, permeable blocks. These features are primarily important for walking and for transit station accessibility, which can be easily discouraged by detours.A prosperous city seeks a tight network of paths and streets offering multiple routes to many destinations that also make walking and cycling trips varied and enjoyable. In fact, cities that have adequate streets, public spaces and greater connectivity are more liveable and productive. The use of this indicator aims to integrate urban form and spatial analysis in the monitoring of Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Spatial indicators are vital tools supporting sustainable urban and regional planning. They are valuable in the generation of spatial data that is critical for priority setting for harmonious and equitable distribution of resources and investments in the territory. This information supports decision-making based on evidence and facilitates effective urban management and the setting of local monitoring mechanisms to assess impact in localized areas.

Proportion of Total Open Public Space = ( (Total surface of open public space + Total surface of land allocated to streets) / Total surface of built up area of the urban agglomeration ) Unit of Measurement: %  The method to estimate the area of public space is based on three steps: 1) spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area of the city; 2) estimation of the total open public space and; 3) estimation of the total area allocated to streets. \t1. Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area. Delimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration and calculate the total area (square kilometers). \t\t1.1 Satellite imagery: Use of exiting layers of satellite imagery ranging from open sources such as Google Earth and US Geological Survey/NASA imagery Landsat to more sophisticated and higher resolution land cover data sets. Images will be analyzed for the latest available year. \t\t1.2 Delimitation of built-up area of the urban agglomeration: The delimitation of the urban agglomeration refers to the total area occupied by the built-up area and its urbanized open space. The delimitation of the study area distinguishes urban, suburban and rural areas based on the built-up densities. This indicators includes urban (more than 50% built-up density) and suburban areas (between 50% to 10% built-up density (refer to annex 1 \"Measurement of the Street Connectivity Index\"). \t2. Open public space: mapping and calculation of total areas of open public space within the defined urban boundaries based on the built-up area. \t\t2.1 Definition of open public space: An open public space is related to universal access. Open public spaces include only the following types: \t\t\tParks: open spaces inside a municipality that provide free air recreation and contact with nature. Their principal characteristic is the significant proportion of green area. \t\t\tCivic parks: open spaces created by building agglomeration around an open area, which was later transformed into a representative, civic area. They are characterised by considerable nature, specifically gardens. They are good place for cultural events and passive recreation. \t\t\tSquares: open spaces created by building agglomeration around an open area. Its main characteristics are the significant proportion of architectonic elements and interaction among buildings and the open area. Squares are usually public spaces that are relevant to the city due to their location, territorial development, or cultural importance. \t\t\tRecreational green areas: public green areas that contribute to environmental preservation. All recreational green areas must guarantee accessibility and must be linked to urban areas. Their main functions are ornamental and passive recreation. \t\t\tFacility public areas: open meeting spaces and recreational facilities that are part of city facilities (defined as places that are elementary to all cities; i.e., public libraries, stadium, public sports centres, etc.). These areas have the following characteristics: public property, free transit and access, and both active and passive recreation. (e.g., the public area outside a stadium). \t\t2.2 Inventory of open public space. Information can be obtained from legal documents outlining publicly owned land and well defined land use plans. In some cases where this information is lacking, incomplete or outdated, open sources and communitybased maps, which are increasingly recognized as a valid source of information, can be a viable alternative. \t\t2.3 Computation of total area of open public space. The inventory of open public spaces is digitalized in existing maps and vectorised to allow computation of surfaces. The total of open public area is divided by the total built-up area of the city to obtain the proportion. \t3. Land allocated to streets: calculation of the total area allocated to streets based on sampling techniques as a proportion of the total surface of the built-up area as per definition above. \t\t3.1 Definition of streets. For this indicator, streets are defined as the space used by pedestrian or vehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city and also in order to interact. More and more, local population recognizes streets as public spaces and as an important 'common' of the city. The area of the streets include the carriageway, the median, the roundabouts, the traffic islands, the sidewalk, the cycle tracks, planting zones and storm drainage; in other words, the right of way limited by private properties and/or natural obstacles such as rivers. In informal settlements or slum areas where sidewalks are missing, the main references for limiting the street area are the physical boundaries used to demarcate the private properties. Unpaved roads are also considered as streets. \t\t3.2 Sampling technique for the estimation of land allocated to streets. The estimation of the total area of the street is based on the following methodology: \t\t\ta. Define the boundary of the built-up area. \t\t\tb. Generate the Halton sequence of sample points of the urban area bounding box for an average density of 10 points per Km2. \t\t\tc. Extract the sample points that are within the urban area boundary. \t\t\td. Buffer the points to get sample areas (circles) with an area of 10 Ha each (0.1 Km2). \t\t\te. For each sample area in the sequence: i) check the completeness of the street network using 'open street maps' (OSM cartography on streets) within the sample area, and complete it if necessary comparing it with the most recent satellite imagery of the urban area; ii) define and delimit streets as per definition; iii) measure the street widths on the orthophoto (i.e. Bing) and store it in the OSM data base; iv) download the OSM cartography; v) superimpose (clip) the OSM data with the sample areas; vi) calculate the land allocated to street for each sample area. \t\t\tf. Repeat the process for the following sample areas until the variations are within a certain margin (95% confidence limits). \t\t3.3 Computation of total area of land allocated to streets. The average of the sample areas provide the total land allocated to streets.

A person or household can be said to have secure tenure when they are protected from involuntary removal from their land or residence by the state, except in exceptional circumstances, and then only by means of a known and agreed legal procedure, which must itself be objective, equally applicable, contestable and independent.\" Perceived tenure security refers to an individual's experience of his/her tenure situation or their estimated probability that their land rights will not be lost as a result of eviction by the state, land owner or other authority, or because of other factors that may cause involuntary relocation or curtail their use of the land, such as threats of land conflicts. Characterizing tenure status is based on four sets of interrelated parameters: \t1. Primary tenure rights on land \t2. Land tenure (rights of occupants on the land) \t3. Occupancy status (of the dwelling unit) \t4. Type of development Legal tenure security refers to the legal status of tenure and its protection backed up by state authority. De facto tenure security is based on the actual control of property, regardless of the legal status in which it is held. It can best be defined by the elements that compose it or contribute to it, such as the length of time of occupation, its socially accepted legitimacy and the level and cohesion of community organization. UNFAO (2003) defines Communally held land is where rights to use resources are held by a community. It refers to situations where rights to use resources are held and controlled by a community. While these rights may include communal rights to pastures and forests, they may also include exclusive private rights to agricultural land and residential plots. Local Communities A group of individuals belonging to the same community residing within or in the same vicinity of a particular parcel, property or natural resource. The community members are co-owners that share exclusive rights and duties, and benefits contribute to the community development. Indigenous land rights Indigenous land rights are rights specific to a particular ethnic group, having evolved through interaction of culture and environment and overseen by authorities whose legitimacy is based on occupation and spiritual ties to the locality. Community land rights Community land rights are collective rights of land ownership, access or use held or exercised in common by members of a community. A community may be designated as a village-based or more geographically dispersed community, or a clan or a lineage. Collective rights A situation where holders of land rights are clearly defined as a group and have the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of those land rights. Collective ownership of a natural resource refers to a situation where the holders of rights to a given natural resource are clearly defined as a collective group, and where they have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights. Common property Common property refers to situations in which entitled beneficiaries hold specified rights in common to specific areas of land, land-based natural resources or other types of property. Property / private property Property signifies dominion or right of use, control and disposition, which one may lawfully exercise over things, objects or land. Property rights Property rights refer to \"a bundle of rights to use, control, and transfer assets, including land. These include the rights to occupy, enjoy and use; to restrict others from entry or use; to dispose, buy or inherit; to develop or improve; to cultivate; to sublet; to realize financial benefits; and to access services in association with land. Open access resources Resources ' including land ' to which everyone has unrestricted access and that are not considered to be the property of anyone. Ecosystem services: Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that directly affect people and supporting services needed to maintain the other services. Natural resources: The term 'natural resources' refers to oil, minerals, forests, water, and fertile land that occur in nature and can be exploited for economic gain.","indicator_name":"Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, with legally recognized documentation and who perceive their rights to land as secure, by sex and by type of tenure","indicator_sort_order":"01-04-02","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"Percentage of women and men with secure tenure rights to individually or communally held land, property and natural resources.

The statistical measurement framework for child labour is structured around (i) the age of the child; (ii) the productive activities by the child, including their nature and the conditions under which these are performed, and the duration of engagement by the child in such activities. For the purpose of statistical measurement, children engaged in child labour include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who, during a specified time period, were engaged in one or more of the following categories of activities: \t(a) worst forms of child labour, (as described in paragraphs 17'30, 18th ICLS resolution); \t(b) employment below the minimum age, (as described in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the 18th ICLS resolution); and \t(c) hazardous unpaid household services, (as described in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the 18th ICLS resolution), applicable where the general production boundary is used as the measurement framework.

This includes cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)- broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed wireless technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations. The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files.

For purposes of that report, Internet broadband access connections are those in service, over 200 kilobits per second (kbps) in at least one direction, and reported to the FCC through Form 477. Form 477 collects information about fixed Internet access connections in service to end-user premises that are advertised to deliver information to and/or from the end user \u2013 that is, in at least one direction \u2013 at transfer rates (speeds) above 200 kilobits per second (kbps). Information is collected about the number of connections by the advertised speeds associated with each product subscribed to in the relevant geographic area (census tracts for fixed). Fixed providers report connections by the maximum advertised upload and download speeds.  Fixed connections are further categorized by the technology employed by the part of the connection that terminates at the end-user premises. \u201cEnd users\u201d are residential, business, institutional, or government entities who use services for their own purposes and who do not resell such services to other entities. Facilities-based providers report information about connections they provide directly to their own end-user customers and also connections that they provide to Internet Service Providers for resale to end users. For Form 477 purposes, the facilities-based provider of a fixed broadband connection is the entity that owns the portion of the physical facility  that terminates at the end-user premises and provisions/equips it as broadband, obtains an unbundled network element (UNE), special access line, or other leased facility that terminates at the end-user premises and provisions/equips it as broadband, or provisions/equips broadband over terrestrial wireless spectrum to the end-user premises. The mutually exclusive Form 477 fixed technology categories are: asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (aDSL), symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (sDSL), other copper wireline, cable modem, optical carrier / fiber to the end user, satellite, terrestrial fixed wireless (using licensed or unlicensed spectrum), and all other (which is included to capture deployment of additional technologies over time). In the Form 477 data collection, aDSL-based services delivered over fiber-to-the-node architecture are reported in the aDSL category. The other wireline category comprises T1/DS1, T3/DS3, and other copper-based connections, not elsewhere categorized, that deliver Internet access service at the end-user premises. Ethernet connections delivering Internet access service are reported in the other wireline category if the connection terminates over copper and in the fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) category if the connection terminates over fiber. Connections deployed over hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) architecture are reported in the cable modem category. Wireless ISPs (WISPs) and satellite network operators report in the fixed wireless category.

The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized. Global gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according to the World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.","indicator_name":"Direct disaster economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP)","indicator_variable":"dsast_loss_pct_global_gdp","method_of_computation":"The original national disaster loss databases usually register physical damage value (housing unit loss, infrastructure loss etc.).

Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. The economic loss indicator would track loss to agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors and damage to housing and critical infrastructure. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. \nThe environment for food production is increasingly challenging, particularly for smallholders, due to environmental and climate-related factors. Similar to extreme income poverty, food insecurity continues to be predominantly concentrated in rural areas of developing countries, and disproportionately affects poor farmers, agricultural workers, pastoralists and rural communities. Common conditions for protracted crisis situations include frequent or continued exposure to shocks that undermine livelihoods, food and market systems. Special consideration needs to be given to population living in areas prone to environmental and natural disaster shocks. \nBiodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track direct physical loss expressed in economic term. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. The indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of direct economic loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism.","reporting_status":"complete","scheduled_update_by_national_source":"5/2019","source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"Andrew.Craig@bea.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"Andrew Craig","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"Saving and Investment by Sector","source_organisation_1":"Saving and Investment by Sector","source_url_1":"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTableHtml.cfm?reqid=9&step=3&isuri=1&903=137","source_url_text_1":"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTableHtml.cfm?reqid=9&step=3&isuri=1&903=137","target":"By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.","target_id":"1.5","time_period":"2000-2018","title":"Direct disaster economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP)","un_custodial_agency":"UNISDR (Partnering Agencies: UNEP, FAO)","un_designated_tier":"2","us_method_of_computation":"Disaster losses divided by World/US GDP expressed as a percentage","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_show_map":false,"source_active_2":false,"page_content":""},"16-1-1":{"graph_type":"line","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","has_metadata":true,"indicator_sort_order":"16-01-01","indicator":"16.1.1","variable_notes":null,"variable_description":null,"layout":"indicator","permalink":"/16-1-1/","sdg_goal":16,"actual_indicator_available":"Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide by sex and age\t\t\t","actual_indicator_available_description":"Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide by sex and age","comments_and_limitations":"NA","computation_units":"Estimated volume number and rate per 100,000\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","data_non_statistical":false,"date_metadata_updated":"June 2019","date_of_national_source_publication":"September 2018","disaggregation_categories":"NA","disaggregation_geography":"National\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-16.pdf","graph_title":"Estimated number of US victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population","indicator_definition":"From UNODC:Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); the rate is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total resident population, expressed per 100,000 population. From Goal 16 TST Working Group:  This indicator is a composite indicator constructed by collecting two numbers, deaths from intentional homicides and deaths from conflict to measure \"peace\" with respect to target 1 ' \"Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related deaths everywhere.\" The rates of intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths should be reported separately, as combining them into one single indicator would risk conflating two distinct phenomena with differing root causes as well as varying levels of precision in measurement. Still, they are useful complements to each other as, by construction, they are exclusive and non-overlapping (ie. By design, their conjunction does not double count violent deaths). Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), 2015). ICCS recommends that intentional homicides include: \tMurder \tHonour killing \tSerious assault leading to death \tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \tDowry-related killings \tFemicide \tInfanticide \tVoluntary manslaughter \tExtrajudicial killings \tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials Conflict-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties, including, but not limited to, those caused by traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments (battle-related deaths). The term conflict-related death is broader than the term \"battlerelated death\" as it includes killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military 'hors combat', killings associated with a conflict (but not accompanied by a battle between warring parties) such as one-sided killings, pogroms and genocides. Following the ICCS definition (see homicides at left) death as a result of terrorist activities would be included in intentional homicides. For both intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, rates are defined as the total count in deaths in a calendar year, respectively, divided by the total resident population for the year, expressed per 100,000 population. The denominator (100,000 population) has been adopted globally by law enforcement as the standard for comparable measurement.","indicator_name":"Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex and age","indicator_variable":"est_vctm_hmcd_ per_100k","periodicity":"Annual\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"From UNODC:\nThis indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security.

Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. \nIf data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and political (including terrorism, hate crime). \nThe interpretation of this indicator is straightforward also for non-specialised users.\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n As described above, this composite indicator is comprised of two forms of violent deaths. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries with ongoing conflicts/wars. Peace is a much broader concept than violent deaths, however, it is difficult to measure many aspects of peace (threats and the fear of violence, insecurity, and other forms of violence, including damages to persons and property). Deaths due to violence are universally and easily understood, are frequently monitored and are comparable with only minor discrepancies in interpretation, largely due to the finality of death. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability.

Because not all law enforcement agencies provide data for complete reporting periods, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimated crime numbers in these presentations.

For agencies supplying 3 to 11 months of data, the national Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program estimates for the missing data by following a standard estimation procedure using the data provided by the agency. If an agency has supplied less than 3 months of data, the FBI computes estimates by using the known crime figures of similar areas within a state and assigning the same proportion of crime volumes to nonreporting agencies. The estimation process considers the following: population size covered by the agency; type of jurisdiction, e.g., police department versus sheriff\u2019s office; and geographic location. Much of the data presented in the Crime in the United States publication are obtained from the Monthly Return of Offenses Known to Police form which is required to participate in the FBI UCR Program. Data sited from the FBI UCR Program\u2019s website regarding the age and sex of a victim of homicide is obtained from the Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR). The SHR provides additional details surrounding the homicide such as victim and offender age, sex, and race, type of weapon, circumstance during a homicide, and the relationship of the victim to the offender. The SHR is not required for participation in the program. Murder victims with unknown age and/or sex are not included in this table. To calculate the estimated number of males, females, and age of the victim, the percent distribution was figured using data supplied to the national UCR Program on the SHR. The resulting figure was then applied to the total estimated number of homicides for the nation. The homicide rate, defined as the number of offenses per 100,000 population, is derived by first dividing the nation\u2019s population by 100,000 and then dividing the number of offenses by the resulting figure.","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_show_map":false,"source_active_2":false,"international_and_national_references":"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/home, https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/","source_url_1":"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/home, https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/","page_content":""},"4-3-1":{"actual_indicator_available":"Percentage of 16- to 65-year-olds enrolling in formal or nonformal programs during the past year, by sex, age group, and high/low income quartile","actual_indicator_available_description":"The first round of data collection in the United States (officially known as the U.S. PIAAC Main Study) was conducted from August 2011 through April 2012 with a nationally representative household sample of 5,000 adults between the ages of 16 and 65. i4_3_1formal_total\t          Percentage participating in formal education, total i4_3_1formal_male\t          Percentage participating in formal education, males i4_3_1formal_female\t          Percentage participating in formal education, females i4_3_1formal_24\t              Percentage participating in formal education, less than age 25 i4_3_1formal_34\t              Percentage participating in formal education, 25 to 34 i4_3_1formal_44               Percentage participating in formal education, 35 to 44 i4_3_1formal_54               Percentage participating in formal education, 45 to 54 i4_3_1formal_65\t              Percentage participating in formal education, 55 to 65 i4_3_1formal_lowquartile\t  Percentage participating in formal education, lowest income quartile i4_3_1formal_midquartiles     Percentage participating in formal education, middle two income quartiles i4_3_1formal_highquartile\t  Percentage participating in formal education, high income quartile i4_3_1nonformal_total\t      Percentage participating in nonformal education, total i4_3_1nonformal_male\t      Percentage participating in nonformal education, males i4_3_1nonformal_female\t      Percentage participating in nonformal education, females i4_3_1nonformal_24\t          Percentage participating in nonformal education, less than age 25 i4_3_1nonformal_34\t          Percentage participating in nonformal education, 25 to 34 i4_3_1nonformal_44\t          Percentage participating in nonformal education, 35 to 44 i4_3_1nonformal_54\t          Percentage participating in nonformal education, 45 to 54 i4_3_1nonformal_65\t          Percentage participating in nonformal education, 55 to 65 i4_3_1nonformal_lowquartile\t  Percentage participating in nonformal education, lowest income quartile i4_3_1nonformal_midquartiles  Percentage participating in nonformal education, middle two income quartiles i4_3_1nonformal_highquartile Percentage participating in nonformal education, high income quartile","comments_and_limitations":"Data subject to sampling errors.","computation_units":"Percentage","data_non_statistical":false,"date_metadata_updated":"11/2016","date_of_national_source_publication":"10/2013","disaggregation_categories":"Sex, age group, income level","disaggregation_geography":"National","goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-4.pdf","graph_title":"Percentage of persons in US ages 16 to 65 enrolling in formal educational programs during the past year","graph_type":"bar","has_metadata":true,"indicator":"4.3.1","indicator_definition":"The percentage of youth and adults in a given age range (e.g. 15-24 years, 25-64 years etc.) participating in formal or non-formal education or training in a given time period (e.g. last 12 months).

In the  PIAAC PS-TRE framework, PS-TRE is defined as: \"using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks.\" PS-TRE measures skills and abilities that are required for solving problems while operating in a technology-rich environment. Specifically, it assesses the cognitive processes of problem solving\u2014goal setting, planning, selecting, evaluating, organizing, and communicating results. The environment in which PS-TRE assesses these processes is meant to reflect the reality that digital technology has revolutionized access to information and communication capabilities over the past decades. In particular, the Internet has immensely increased instantaneous access to large amounts of information in multiple formats and has expanded capabilities of instant voice, text, visual, and graphic communications across the globe. In order to effectively operate in this environment, it is necessary to have mastery of foundational computer (ICT) skills, including (a) skills associated with manipulating input and output devices (e.g., the mouse, keyboard, and digital displays), (b) awareness of concepts and knowledge of how the environment is structured (e.g., files, folders, scrollbars, hyperlinks, and different types of menus or buttons), and (c) the ability to interact effectively with digital information (e.g., how to use commands such as save, delete, open, close, move, highlight, submit, and send). Such interaction involves familiarity with electronic texts, images, graphics and numerical data, as well as the ability to locate, evaluate, and critically judge the validity, accuracy, and appropriateness of accessed information. These skills constitute the core aspects of the PIAAC PS-TRE assessment. Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments items present tasks of varying difficulty to be performed in simulated software applications using commands and functions commonly found in the technology environments of email, web pages, and spreadsheets.

The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator is an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration and survey and census data. Civil registration: In the case of civil registration the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.'' Survey data: In the case of survey data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of retrospective birth histories. The numerator refers to births to women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the birth during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator to person_years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. Whenever possible, the reference period corresponds to the five years preceding the survey. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys, no retrospective birth histories are available and the estimate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.'' Census data: With census data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under_registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own_children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census (See: http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19 October 2009.) If numbers are available, adolescent fertility at ages under 15 years can also be computed. Method of estimation The United Nations Population Division compiles and updates data on adolescent fertility rates for MDG monitoring. Estimates based on civil registration are provided when the country reports at least 90% coverage and there is reasonable agreement between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Survey estimates are provided only when there is no reliable civil registration. Given the restrictions of the United Nations MDG database, only one source is provided by year and country. In such cases precedence is given to the survey programme conducted most frequently at the country level, with other survey programmes using retrospective birth histories, census and other surveys in that order.

The number of jobs in the economy thus exceeds the number of persons employed to the extent that some employees have more than one job (SNA 2008 para. 19.30 in IRTS 2008 Compilation Guide para. 7.6). Consequently, the number of jobs (demand side) and the number of persons employed (supply side) are dissimilar categories and therefore usually do not match.

It is recognized that the suggested indicator does not cater to all dimensions of the target, but finding one indicator that would do so seems unviable, certainly over the short-medium term. \nThere is the added challenge that the concept \"sustainable tourism\" is mainly a policy construct and not defined nor part of an established or internationally conceptual/statistical framework at this point. Even though UNWTO together with a number of countries, UNSD and OECD, and counting on the support of the UNCEEA are putting put in motion an initiative towards developing the measurement of the relationship between tourism and sustainability, notably through linking SEEA and TSA, it seems that the production of internationally comparable data on (something that could approximate for) \"sustainable tourism\" in a significant number of countries still has some years to go. \nFor the meantime, the suggested indicator (in its two parts, on tourism related GDP and jobs) seems to be a sensible approximation because (a) it is a good conceptual fit to some key dimensions of the target (b) it stems from a systems approach and is based on sound internationally agreed methodology, and (c) there is a significant number of countries already producing data for this indicator. In addition, the suggested indicator (tourism related GDP and jobs) is in line with Goal 8's general focus on economic growth and employment. \nFinally, the TDGDP/GDP part of this indicator can complement Target 14.7's indicator: \"Fisheries as a % of GDP\" in order to cater to tourism dimension of this target. \n\n Interpretation \n Target 8.9 has several dimensions; this caters to the dimension: tourism that creates jobs. It could also give an indication on how successful the \"promotion\" of tourism as job creator is being: promote [...] tourism that creates jobs.","reporting_status":"complete","scheduled_update_by_national_source":"June, 2019 (Will incorporate 2012 Input-Output Accounts, released November 1, 2018)","sdg_goal":8,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_name_1":"Andrew Craig (Kali Kong July, 2018)","source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":"Andrew Craig (Kali Kong July, 2018)","source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":"https://www.bea.gov/scb/2018/06-june/0618-us-travel-tourism-satellite-account.htm","source_url_text_1":"https://www.bea.gov/scb/2018/06-june/0618-us-travel-tourism-satellite-account.htm","target":"By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.","target_id":"8.9","title":"Proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total tourism jobs","un_custodial_agency":"UNWTO","un_designated_tier":"3 (with data)","us_method_of_computation":"(US Direct Tourism-related Employment)/(US Total Tourism-related Employment)","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"16-9-1":{"actual_indicator_available":"Percent of US births registered in all 50 states and the District of Columbia","actual_indicator_available_description":"Percent of annual births occurring in the United states to residents and non-residents registered by a vital statistics jurisdiction","comments_and_limitations":"Births are registered by state vital registration systems.

They may participate as voters, candidates for local, regional and national elections, members of parliament or local council, heads of state and government, ministers, members of political parties, trade unions or business associations, or as electoral administrators. \nCapturing an accurate assessment of women's representation across these different forms of political participation has been difficult, however. The standard measure of women's political participation and involvement in decision-making, used to track progress for the Millennium Development Goals, was the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. In many respects, the existence and quality of this data has meant that other areas of political participation have not been paid sufficient attention. \nMeasuring women's participation in local government is an additional, but equally important measure of women's political participation and decision-making, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is seats) available to women candidates at this level. Women's entry into local politics has the potential to influence a wide range of policy decisions and local community programmes. \nHowever, the available data is limited; it is neither comprehensive across all countries, nor regularly updated. Data from the United Nations Statistical Division's 2010 edition of The World's Women, for example, show selected regional averages, with a low of 8 percent in Northern Africa to a high of 30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. Averages across Latin America and Europe ranged from 24 to 29 percent and Asia reported averages below 20 percent. Drawing meaningful conclusions from this data is therefore difficult. \nIn 1995, the Beijing Platform for Action called on governments to accept a wider understanding of women's participation in decision-making that went beyond women in national politics. The 20-year review of the Platform, however, found that: \n\ta significant challenge for effectively monitoring progress towards gender equality is the lack of high quality and comparable data, collected over time. Many areas of statistics that are of critical importance such as ' women's participation in decision-making at all levels, including local government ' are still not produced regularly by countries. Data and statistical requirements for the post-2015 development agenda will be substantial, particularly for monitoring gender equality, women's empowerment and the human rights of women and girls in the new framework. \nA dedicated indicator on women's political participation would provide the necessary 'data mandate' to ensure this data set is more systematically collected across all countries and regularly monitored over time, allowing for both international and longitudinal comparisons.","reporting_status":"complete","source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"FN-OMB-OIRA-SDGs@omb.eop.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"OMB","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2019; ","source_organisation_1":"Center for American Women and Politics, Eagleton Institute of Politics, Rutgers University","source_url_1":"http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/WIC/Historical-Data/Women-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/","source_url_text_1":"http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/WIC/Historical-Data/Women-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/","target":"Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life","target_id":"5.5","title":"Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments","un_custodial_agency":"IPU, UN Women (Partnering Agencies: World Bank)","un_designated_tier":"1 (a) 2 (b)","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_show_map":false,"source_active_2":false,"page_content":""},"17-12-1":{"comments_and_limitations":"Under review.

The PTT scores are scaled to the range between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates that the target is met and decreasing scores indicate an increasing distance from the target. \t2.

The number of victims is defined as the number of detected and estimated number of non-detected adult women and men and girls and boys (18-) who have been trafficked for different forms of trafficking in persons. The estimated ratio between the number of detected victims and the estimated number of non-detected victims can be used to estimate the total number of human trafficking victims at national, regional and global levels. In addition, the ratio can be used to measure the efficiency of countries to detect trafficking victims.  From Goal 16 TST Working Group:  This is an outcome indicator derived from administrative data. The indicator is computed as the total number of identified victims of trafficking divided by population (per 100,000 persons).

The regular production of figures on this indicator will allow the monitoring of the impact of the anti-trafficking measures to the level of trafficking at national, regional and global levels.

The data are predominantly recorded on an accrual basis. Data on tax revenues are recorded without offsets for the administrative expenses connected with tax collection.

Part (a) and part (b) cannot be seen as two different indicators, they rather provide two complementary information. Plus, they can be computed using (almost) the same data, the main difference between the 2 parts being only the denominator.  Definition of agricultural land: Since Target 1.4 explicitly refers to equal rights on economic resources, the proposed indicator focuses on land that can be used as a productive resource for livelihood development, thus the focus on agricultural land. The focus on land as productive resource (or for livelihood development) helps deriving indication on empowerment and advancement towards poverty reduction, compared to lands used for other purposes that are not economically and livelihood-related. This is particularly true in developing countries where poverty reduction strategies are necessarily linked to agricultural development. The term 'agricultural land' is used to indicate land used for farming, livestock and forestry activities. This emphasizes the importance to monitor ownership/secure rights on land of farm-based livelihood people as well as people whose main source of livelihood is livestock and forestry. Similarly the term 'agricultural population' has to be intended in a broad sense ' i.e. including people living out of farming, livestock and forestry, with land rights or without (landless). Definition of ownership and rights over land: The landowner is the legal owner of the land. Definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys. For instance, documented ownership means that ownership is verified through title or deed, while reported ownership relies on individuals' own judgment. Reported ownership may be more appropriate in countries where a formal registration system is not in place. Additionally, in some countries, particularly where land private ownership is not applicable, it is more appropriate to investigate rights over land using proxies able to capture individuals' capability to control and take decisions over the land. This may include settings where customary rights prevail as opposed to individual ownership. Proxies of such \"bundle of rights\" may include the right to sell, to bequeath or the right to decide how to use the land. Since the definition of ownership and land rights has to take into account what is more relevant in the country, the indicator will need to be complemented with metadata that specify what definition(s) of ownership or rights over land is/are employed. Tenure Type Finally and most importantly, this indicator has to be disaggregated by type of tenure. Therefore, the data collection methodology should always include a question on land tenure. Land tenure refers to the arrangements or rights under which people have access to land, and it is one of the key elements to tenure security.5 There are different formal and informal tenure systems around the world and the distinction between legal and non-legal tenure is often blurred. When available, the indicator shall also be disaggregated by documented tenure rights. The FAO World Census of Agriculture encourages countries to use country-specific types of tenure whilst ensuring the possibility to classify ex-post under the following broad categories: 1) legal ownership or legal owner-like possession; 2) Non-legal ownership or non-legal owner-like possession; 3) Rented land from someone else; 4) Various other types of land tenure. Broadly speaking, legal ownership or legal owner-like possession describes land rights that provide statutory security of tenure. This may be done through a formal land title system, but may also include certain forms of customary land tenure arrangements where land rights are registered or certified in some way. The following types of tenure arrangements may be included under this heading: \tOwnership is certified through a title, which gives the individual the right to determine the nature and extent of the use of the land. \tLand is held under conditions that enable it to be operated as if legally owned. E.g., the land is operated under hereditary tenure, perpetual lease, or long-term lease, with nominal or no rent. \tThe land is held under a tribal, communal, or traditional form of tenure, which is legally recognized by the state. Such arrangements usually involve land being held on a tribal, village, kindred or clan basis, with land ownership being communal in character but with certain individual rights being held by virtue of membership in the social unit. Such arrangements can be formalized through the establishment of legal procedures to identify the community's land and to manage the land rights of community members.","indicator_name":"(a) Proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rightsbearers of agricultural land, type of tenure","indicator_sort_order":"05-0a-01","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"We propose using the 'total agricultural population' as denominator of part (a), instead of the total population, because ownership or right-security over agricultural land is obviously relevant only for the people whose livelihood rely on agriculture.

With the exception of Appendix I species, most protected wildlife is legally traded. Poaching is defined as the illegal taking of wildlife for the purposes of international trade. Illicit trafficking is defined as illegal import or export of wildlife. Export Permits are required to export CITES-listed wildlife by every Member State (defined in Article VI of CITES, which regulates the information export permit shall contain and in Resolution Conf. 8.5, in which the Conference of the Parties to the Convention agreed on the information to be included in an export permit. Seizures are the result of confiscation of wildlife or wildlife products by national law enforcement authorities. Seizures occur when law enforcement authorities have suspicion that the wildlife or wildlife product they encounter is obtained or trafficked illegally. Depending on where, when and why national law enforcement authorities seize wildlife and wildlife products, the information about the seized items corresponds more or less to the variables defined by CITES in the export permit.

Step 1. Calculating the quarterly and annual compound growth rates. A CGR is the growth rate in a time series over a certain amount of time. It is computed as [see report]. A quarterly CGR (CQGR) is calculated by considering periods of three months between ____ and __0, while an annual CGR (CAGR) is calculated by considering a period of 12 months. The importance to consider both CQGR and CAGR derives from the need to take into account the presence of marked seasonal variability in many agricultural prices, with prices growing more or less steadily over the year from their minimum, occurring at harvest period. Step 2. Calculating the weighted average and standard deviation of both CQGR and CAGR. The historic distributions of CGRs are characterized by the mean and the standard deviation of past CGR values. A different distribution of CGRs is computed per each calendar month. Time weights are used to make sure that the more recent past has a higher weight in the calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of CGRs, so that more recent price dynamics are not overshadowed by past extreme events which could prevent the detection of significant market shocks on prices.  Step 4. Computing the indicator of price anomalies. First, the difference between the monthly CGR and the historic average CGR is computed for each month and then normalized with respect to the historic standard deviation.

From non-solid fuels to clean fuels Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking, categorized as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered polluting and non-modern, while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating. New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO ( i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits. For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as \"access to clean fuels and technologies\" rather than \"access to non-solid fuels.\" This shift will help ensure that health and other \"nexus\" benefits are better counted, and thus realized.

Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel model. The model only accounts for regions, countries and time as a spline function, and estimates are restricted to values ranging from zero to one. More details on the model are published elsewhere (Bonjour et al, 2013). Estimates for countries with no available surveys were obtained as follows: \tWhen survey data is available for a country, the regional populationweighted mean is used to derive aggregate estimates at a regional or global level, however no country point estimate is given for that country is reported \tCountries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,746.- per capita are assumed to have made a complete transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic energy source for cooking and the primary reliance on polluting (unclean) fuels and technologies use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed as zero for regional and global estimates.

For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting.

Such planning is done with the patient by establishing goals based on the patient's identified needs and setting interventions to meet those goals (UNODC, Principles of Drug Dependence Treatment: Discussion Paper, March 2008). \tCounselling refers to an intensive interpersonal process aimed at assisting individuals to achieve their goals or function more effectively (WHO). \tPeer support groups (self-help groups such as Narcotics Anonymous) refers to small groups of peers wishing to assist each other in their struggle with a particular problem (in the case of Narcotics Anonymous, with drug dependence) (WHO). \tScreening is aimed at detecting health problems or risk factors at an early stage before they have caused serious disease or other problems (WHO). A 'brief intervention' is a structured therapy of short duration aimed at assisting an individual to cease or reduce the use of a psychoactive substance or to deal with other life issues (WHO). \tContingency management' refers to psychosocial interventions that provide a system of incentives and disincentives designed to make drug use less attractive and abstinence more attractive (NIDA). \tCognitive behavioural therapy refers to psychosocial interventions aimed at helping patients recognize, avoid and cope with the situations in which they are most likely to use drugs (adapted from NIDA). \tMotivational interviewing refers to a counselling and assessment technique that follows a non-confrontational approach to questioning people about difficult issues like alcohol and drug use, assisting them to make positive decisions aimed at reducing or stopping such use (ODCCP). Social rehabilitation and aftercare include a cluster of interventions such as vocational training, social assistance, educational activities, rehabilitation and aftercare. \tVocational training and income-generation support' refers to activities aimed at providing participants with the skills and opportunities to engage in meaningful employment and sustainably support themselves and their families. \tSocial assistance refers to the many ways in which professionals and nonprofessionals can support the social and psychological well-being of drug users with a view to improving both the quality and duration of their lives (WHO, Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, 2009). \tEducational activities on the risks posed by drug use refer to sessions aimed at informing and counselling people about the consequences of drug use, in other words, the ways in which such use affects physical and mental health, behavioural control and interpersonal relationships. In particular, these educational sessions should focus on providing information about overdosing, contracting infectious diseases, developing cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders etc. and the benefit of abstaining from drug use. Treatment methods and goals are also explained in detail. \tRehabilitation and aftercare refers to the process aimed at achieving an optimal state of health, psychological functioning and social well-being for individuals with a drugrelated problem (WHO). Coverage Coverage describes the extent to which an intervention is delivered to the target population, that is, the proportion of the target population in need of an intervention that actually gets it. Coverage has to be determined relative to the national estimates of people in need, e.g., people with substance use disorders, or people vulnerable to substance use.

It is a thematic disaggregation of the multi-purpose indicator for protected area coverage of important sites. Concepts Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use: \tCategory Ia: Strict nature reserve \tCategory Ib: Wilderness area \tCategory II: National park \tCategory III: Natural monument or feature \tCategory IV: Habitat/species management area \tCategory V: Protected landscape/seascape \tCategory VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources The status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military). Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world's countries. The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (AZEs), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 AZE sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of key biodiversity areas (KBAs) unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems is in the final stages of development and anticipated to be in place by the end of 2015.

Importantly, it is not restricted to any single marine ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 14.2. \nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. \nIn addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have become places of high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values. \nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of territorial area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100.

It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Directly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate \"directly affected\" as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of \"directly affected\", or those who are \tInjured or ill, \tEvacuated, \tRelocated and to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \tPeople who received food relief aid. Injured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. Evacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. Relocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. People whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. Houses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. Houses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. People who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ).

Make the sum a relative figure by using global population data (World Bank or UN Statistics information). Relativity is important because population growth (expected to be 9 billion in 2050) may translate into increased hazard exposure of population. The Expert Group recommends not using the indicators related with the people whose houses were damaged/destroyed in the computation. UNISDR and IRDR groups recommend using them as they can be estimated from widely available and verifiable data and reflect vulnerability and livelihood issues. Data on housing damage and destroyed is essential for economic loss, so using these indicators would not impose additional data collection burden. Double-counting: From practical perspective, double counting of affected people is unavoidable (for example, injured and relocated) in many countries. Minimum double counting is summing 'number of injured' and Number of people whose housings were damaged or destroyed. Relocated is sub-set of number of people whose housings were destroyed. The data can be disaggregated by hazard type. When applied to proposed target 13.1 and 15.3, hydrological, meteorological and climatological and indirectly biological disasters are monitored.","periodicity":"Annual","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. Human loss can be measured by the number of deaths, missing, injured or ill, evacuated, relocated, people whose houses were damaged/destroyed and people who received food relief aid as a direct result of the hazardous events. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. Biodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track human-related loss. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. \nThe indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of human related loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism. \n(mainly based on TST Issue Brief 2, 5, 20 and 23-26)","reporting_status":"complete","source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_name_1":"OMB (formerly: Amy Rosenband, NSC)","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_organisation_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_url_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","source_url_text_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","target":"By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.","target_id":"11.5","title":"Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","un_custodial_agency":"UNISDR (Partnering Agencies: WMO, UNFCCC, UNEP)","un_designated_tier":"2","us_method_of_computation":"US Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness, including the National Preparedness Goal and the National Preparedness System","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_show_map":false,"source_active_2":false,"page_content":""},"17-14-1":{"actual_indicator_available":null,"actual_indicator_available_description":null,"comments_and_limitations":null,"computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":true,"date_metadata_updated":null,"date_of_national_source_publication":null,"disaggregation_categories":null,"disaggregation_geography":null,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf","graph_title":"Number of countries with mechanisms in place to enhance policy coherence of sustainable development","graph_type":null,"has_metadata":false,"indicator":"17.14.1","indicator_definition":"","indicator_name":"Number of countries with mechanisms in place to enhance policy coherence of sustainable development","indicator_sort_order":"17-14-01","indicator_variable":null,"international_and_national_references":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","periodicity":null,"permalink":"/17-14-1/","published":false,"rationale_interpretation":"","reporting_status":"notstarted","scheduled_update_by_SDG_team":null,"scheduled_update_by_national_source":null,"sdg_goal":17,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":null,"source_agency_staff_name_1":null,"source_agency_survey_dataset_1":null,"source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":null,"target":"Enhance policy coherence for sustainable development.","target_id":"17.14","time_period":null,"title":"Number of countries with mechanisms in place to enhance policy coherence of sustainable development","un_custodial_agency":"UNEP","un_designated_tier":"3","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"16-3-2":{"graph_type":"line","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","has_metadata":true,"indicator_sort_order":"16-03-02","indicator":"16.3.2","variable_notes":null,"variable_description":null,"layout":"indicator","permalink":"/16-3-2/","sdg_goal":16,"actual_indicator_available":"Percent unsentenced detainees of inmates held in state and federal prisons and local jails","actual_indicator_available_description":"Number of inmates held in prisons who were unsentenced and inmates held in local jails who were not convicted divided by total number of inmates in prison or jails time 100%.","comments_and_limitations":"National Prisoners Statistics (NPS) - Started in 1926 under a mandate from Congress, NPS collects annual data on prisoners at yearend. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) sponsors the survey, and the U.S. Census Bureau serves as the data collection agent. The NPS distinguishes between inmates in custody and prisoners under jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a state or the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must hold that inmate in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction over a prisoner, the state or BOP must have legal authority over that prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised. The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons, penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, farms, training or treatment centers, and hospitals. Counts also include prisoners who were temporarily absent (less than 30 days), in court, or on work release; housed in privately operated facilities, local jails, or other state or federal facilities; and serving concurrent sentences for more than one correctional authority. The NPS custody counts include all inmates held within a respondent\u2019s facilities, including inmates housed for other correctional facilities. The custody counts exclude inmates held in local jails and in other jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, the NPS custody counts exclude inmates held in privately operated facilities. Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) - In years between a complete census of local jails, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). ASJ uses a stratified probability sample of jail jurisdictions to estimate the number and characteristics of local inmates nationwide. In the sampling design, the jail jurisdictions nationwide are grouped into 10 strata. In 2017, the 10 strata were defined by two variables: the jail jurisdiction average daily population (ADP), and whether the jurisdiction held at least one juvenile. For 8 of the 10 strata, a random sample of jail jurisdictions was selected. For the remaining two strata, all jurisdictions were included in the sample. One stratum consisted of all jails that were operated jointly by two or more jurisdictions (referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). The other stratum (referred to as certainty stratum) consisted of all jail jurisdictions that held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2013 Census of Jail Inmates and had an ADP of 500 or more inmates during the 12 months ending December 31, 2013; or held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more; or were located in California; or were known to be operating in 2015 but were not included n the 2013 Census of Jails. BJS obtains data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed and web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls, the item response rate for jails that responded to the 2016 survey ranged from 94% to 100%. BJS implements nonresponse weight adjustment procedures to account for unit nonresponse and a weighted sequential hot-deck/cold-deck imputation procedure for critical items.

Measuring the relative extent to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and ensuring its proportionate use.","reporting_status":"complete","scheduled_update_by_national_source":"November 2019","source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"allen.beck@ojp.usdoj.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"Bureau of Justice Statistics (provided by Allen J.

It is based on the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This indicator is expressed as an index ranging from 0 to 1. Concepts Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The IUCN Red List Index (RLI) therefore accounts for such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice.","indicator_name":"Red List Index","indicator_sort_order":"15-05-01","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/15-5-1/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"The world's species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated. \nThe IUCN RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as 'Least Concern') to 0 (all species are categorized as 'Extinct'). An intermediate value indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the IUCN RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the IUCN RLI over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward IUCN RLI trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track towards halting the loss of biodiversity and thus preventing the extinction of threatened species by 2020. An IUCN RLI value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted. \nThe name \"Red List Index\" should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics, in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled. Rather, the RLI is an indicator of trends in species' extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, and is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":15,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.","target_id":"15.5","title":"Red List Index","un_custodial_agency":"IUCN  (Partnering Agencies: UNEP; CITES)","un_designated_tier":"1","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"3-1-1":{"data_non_statistical":true,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-3.pdf","graph_title":"Maternal mortality ratio","graph_type":null,"has_metadata":true,"indicator":"3.1.1","indicator_definition":"The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100 000 live births, for a specified time period.","indicator_name":"Maternal mortality ratio","indicator_sort_order":"03-01-01","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births Method of measurement The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death. The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g. last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross_country or over_time comparisons. To reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator surveys (MICS4) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy_related mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio. Censuses have also included questions about maternal deaths with variable success. Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these deaths are maternal or pregnancy_ related. Method of estimation For facility data_based maternal mortality, the denominator is estimated using population projections. WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division and The World Bank have developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data. Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank. Data available from countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. Currently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country_reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories ' those with no appropriate maternal mortality data'__'a statistical model is employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality. It is advised to consider the estimates together with the reported uncertainty margins within which the true levels are known to lie.

In GFS, taxes are classified into six major categories: (i) taxes on income, profits, and capital gains; (ii) taxes on payroll and workforce; (iii) taxes on property; (iv) taxes on goods and services; (v) taxes on international trade and transactions; and (vi) other taxes. (Source: IMF, Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), Table 4A.1, assessed Dec 28 2015) Concepts Tax burden concept may be disaggregated into the complementary concepts of: \"direct taxes\" or taxes that take into account individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes on individual and corporate income), which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications: 111 Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains+1131 Recurrent taxes on immovable property+1132 Recurrent taxes on net wealth+1136 Other recurrent taxes on property; and \"indirect taxes\" or taxes that do not take into account individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes imposed on goods and services), which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications 112 Taxes on payroll and workforce+114 Taxes on goods and services+115 Taxes on international trade and transactions+116 Other taxes. Tax burden is directly related to the wider concept of fiscal burden, which can be derived from combining two GFSM 2014 revenue codes: code 11 Taxes plus code 12, Social Contributions or, alternatively 11+121+122. These concepts can also be found in the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The coverage, timing, and valuation of tax revenue in GFSM 2014 and the 2008 SNA are identical, but the classification systems differ. The 2008 SNA classifies taxes according to their role in economic activities'namely: (i) taxes on production and imports (D2); (ii) current taxes on income, wealth, etc. (D5); and (iii) capital taxes (D91). The result is that some categories of taxes in GFS need to be allocated between two of the SNA tax categories according to whether they are payable by producers or final consumers, or whether they are current or capital taxes. A detailed description of the linkages between the GFS and the 2008 SNA categories of taxes is provided in Appendix 7 of the GFSM 2014.","indicator_name":"Proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes","indicator_sort_order":"17-01-02","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/17-1-2/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"Measures of tax burden are indicators of how well tax policy meets one of its primary goals, equitably raising the revenues needed to run government. Equity has two aspects. The first, vertical equity, concerns the way taxes are distributed among taxpayers with different abilities to pay. The second, horizontal equity, concerns the way taxes are distributed among taxpayers with the same ability to pay. Tax burden measures thus answer broad economic and social questions about the effect of tax policy on the distribution of income and wealth. \nThe distinction regarding national, state and/or local level government is important. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, the central budget is seen as the focus (even if some of tax payments go to other jurisdictions). When decisions about resources are made, the budgetary central government is a key subsector of the general government sector of the economy. The general government sector consists of resident institutional units that fulfill the functions of government as their primary activity. In all countries, there is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, in particular the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government's revenue and expense are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 Chapter 2). \nThere is a widespread acceptance ' in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and indeed in Agenda 2030 ' that multiple sources of finance will be needed to meet the SDGs, and that these will need to work together effectively. This includes a greater role for domestic resources in meeting national development goals, and for interventions in which public resources ' including ODA - strengthen domestic capacities for expanding their revenue bases. Indeed, especially in developing countries, vertical fiscal gaps will potentially widen as demands increase for higher public spending ' particularly in countries where there is significant pressure on central authorities to provide quality infrastructure and basic services. In many cases the execution of the budgetary central government's proposed budget is constrained by poor revenue administration and/or a lack of a statistical framework for monitoring revenue streams. Given unpredictable and fluctuating levels of revenue in many developing countries, improved revenue statistics will help mitigate any possible budget shortfalls and support the sustainable development of national economies.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":17,"source_active_1":true,"source_notes_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"target":"Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection.","target_id":"17.1","title":"Proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes","un_custodial_agency":"IMF","un_designated_tier":"1","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"4-7-1":{"actual_indicator_available":"Percentage of 8th grade respondents who are in public and private schools that emphasize \"world affairs\" to a moderate or great extent.

The indicator has various key qualifiers that are scored between 0-5 (0-none, and 5 for full compliance). Tools to be used to support the reporting on this indicator include: baseline, benchmarking, point-of-service surveys, scorecard, peer-review and experts opinion, performance monitoring and reporting, focus group discussions, gap and content analysis. With initial support of UN-Habitat and partners tracking and assessment tools and methods will be developed, piloted and rolled out at country level to assess national urban policies developed and implemented based on the qualifiers listed above. Based on expert opinion, the assessment of the qualifiers of the indicator will target national government institutions as well as other key urban stakeholders from academia, private sector, and civil society organization, as per specific criteria of selection of these stakeholders. A threshold will be established to ascertain the level of satisfaction of each qualifier. The method for tracking and analysing progress on national urban policies will collate information on adopted policies, conventions, laws, government programs, and other initiatives that comprise an urban policy. This information would be in most cases already available. The analysis will cover the qualifiers listed above. The standard definition of National Urban Policy5 will be extended and adapted to country context and may include where applicable terms such as National Urban Plan, Frameworks, Strategies, etc. as long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers. For each of the 8 items defined above, policies will be scored on a scale of 1 to 5 for achievement or lack of achievement. Overall aggregate national scores (X) will range from 8 to 40 and these will be standardized to the scale of 0-100 using the following approach. If (X) is the observed aggregate value of the score for the policy performance using the above criterion, then its standardized value X(S) will be computed as; X(s) = 100 ( (X - Min(X) / Max(X) - Min(X) ) Where, Max (X) and Min (X) are the maximum and minimum values observed for X which is 8 and 40, respectively. Countries that achieve maximum values on the scorecard i.e. Max (X) =40, the value assigned via standardization will be 100 while those that achieve minimum score i.e. Min (X) =8 the value assigned via standardization will be 0. Unit: Number/dimensionless Number of countries which have scored above the threshold and are making progress on the range of qualifiers.

This indicator is one of the key metrics to benchmark and monitor urbanisation and asserts the national leadership and political will of national governments. This indicator is based on the notion that the development and implementation of national urban policies should support participation, partnership, cooperation and coordination of actors and facilitate dialogue. \nThis indicator will provide a good barometer on global progress on sustainable national urban policies. It serves as gap analysis to support policy recommendations. The indicator can identify good practices and policies among countries that can promote partnership and cooperation between all stakeholders. \nThis indicator is both process oriented and aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 and other SDGs indicators with an urban component. The indicators has the ability to work at multi jurisdictions level, covering a number of areas while taking care of urban challenges in a more integrated national manner. The indicator has a strong connection to the target, addressing the fundamental spatial and territorial aspect of national urban policy in the context of urban, peri-urban and rural areas. \nSuitability: \nThis indicator epitomises the universality tenet and spirit of the SDGs. It is clearly suitable for all countries and can be disaggregated and/or aggregated by areas of development as explained in the methodology section of this metadata.

They include legally earned value, money and monetized instruments that are transferred illicitly or value, money and monetized instruments that are acquired through illegal activities, such as the proceeds of crimes, including corruption and tax evasion. They can also capture tax avoidance and trade misinvoicing. Although the UN Economic Commission for Africa, UNDP, Global Financial Integrity and others have produced global country-by-country estimates for illicit financial flows, more work on methodologies would be required. Overview of the main methods of estimating illicit financial flows (adapted from the Mbeki Report of the High-level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa (http://www.uneca.org/iff)): In terms of the methodologies used to estimate IFFs, several empirical models have been used to estimate both the magnitude of IFFs and their economic implications for developing countries. These models and the analytic methods underlying them deserve further scrutiny. In particular, four methods have dominated the empirical literature: the Hot Money Method, the Dooley Method, the World Bank Residual Method and the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS)'based Trade Mispricing Method. The latter two remain the most widely used. The Hot Money Method records IFFs through net errors and omissions in payment balances. The Dooley Method relies on the privately held foreign assets reported in the balance of payments that do not generate investment income. The World Bank Residual Method estimates IFFs as the difference between the source of funds (external debt and foreign direct investment) and the use of funds (current account deficit and reserves). The Trade Mispricing Model assesses IFFs by looking for disparities arising from overinvoicing of imports and underinvoicing of exports after adjusting for ordinary price differences. In this model, imports are generally recorded after adjusting for the cost of insurance and freight, while exports are usually valued free-on-board. To provide the most thorough estimates of IFFs, Global Financial Integrity has combined the World Bank Residual Method and the Trade Mispricing Model in its computations. ECA has used the Trade Mispricing Model (see Mbeki report). An Overview of the Analytical Methodologies Utilized by Global Financial Integrity to Study Illicit Financial Flows (adapted from their website: http://www.gfintegrity.org/issues/illicit-financial-flows-analytical-methodologies-utilizedglobal-financial-integrity/): Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimates that nearly US$1 trillion of unrecorded money flows out of developing countries annually. There are three forms of unrecorded money moving across borders: \tCorrupt: Proceeds of bribery and theft by government officials. \tCriminal: Proceeds of drug trading, human trafficking, counterfeiting, contraband, and myriad forms of additional activities. \tCommercial: Proceeds arising from import and export transactions conducted so as to manipulate customs duties, VAT taxes, income taxes, excise taxes, or other sources of government revenues. In analyzing IFFs, GFI utilizes sources of data and analytical methodologies that have been used by international institutions, governments, and economists for decades. Basically, these data sources and methodologies are providing information on gaps'gaps in balance of payments data and gaps in trade data. Where recorded sources and uses of funds in balance of payments data do not match, the difference is net errors and omissions, indicating an inflow or outflow that was not recorded. Where bilateral trade data does not match (after adjusting for freight and insurance in the data of the importing country) this indicates reinvoicing of transactions between export from one country and import into another country. Some reviewers of GFI's data sources and analytical methodologies have raised questions, which GFI is pleased to address as follows: \tGFI well recognizes that statistics can be flawed, due to errors in collection, recording, or conveying. Precisely the same point can be made about virtually every other economic analysis ever undertaken. GFI uses the best data available, data that has been collected, reported, and recorded by governments for decades according to international guidelines issued by the IMF. \tThe reliability and accuracy of trade statistics of developing countries are regularly assessed through the IMF's Data Quality Assessment Framework under the Data component of the Reports on Standards and Codes. These ratings show that for all assessed developing countries (about 72) the quality is \"very high\" or \"high\". \tGFI does not suggest that every single unrecorded transaction is illicit; however, the vast majority of unrecorded transactions are illicit. \tGFI does not use net illicit outflows and illicit inflows. In countries where unrecorded outflows and unrecorded inflows roughly balance, it would be a mistake to consider that such a country has no problem with unrecorded flows. There is no such concept as \"net crime.\" Indeed, in GFI's view, illicit outflows and illicit inflows should be added, since both sides of the equation generally produce harm.  From UNODC:  There is no single, agreed definition of illicit financial flows (IFF), but essentially these are financial flows generated by methods, practices and crimes aiming to transfer financial capital in contravention of national or international laws. When anlyzing IFF the following components are generally included: proceeds of crime, proceeds of corruption (national or international corruption), money laundering (including from proceeds of crime), tax evasion, theft of state assets, and market and regulatory abuses.","indicator_name":"Total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (in current United States dollars).","indicator_sort_order":"16-04-01","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","permalink":"/16-4-1/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"From Goal 16 TST Working Group and OHCHR: \n The indicator measures an important aspect of target 16.4.

The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized. Global gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according to the World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.","indicator_name":"Direct economic loss in relation to global GDP, damage to critical infrastructure and number of disruptions to basic services, attributed to disasters","indicator_variable":"dsast_loss_pct_global_gdp","method_of_computation":"The original national disaster loss databases usually register physical damage value (housing unit loss, infrastructure loss etc.).

Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. The economic loss indicator would track loss to agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors and damage to housing and critical infrastructure. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. \nThe environment for food production is increasingly challenging, particularly for smallholders, due to environmental and climate-related factors. Similar to extreme income poverty, food insecurity continues to be predominantly concentrated in rural areas of developing countries, and disproportionately affects poor farmers, agricultural workers, pastoralists and rural communities. Common conditions for protracted crisis situations include frequent or continued exposure to shocks that undermine livelihoods, food and market systems. Special consideration needs to be given to population living in areas prone to environmental and natural disaster shocks. \nBiodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation.

Concepts A National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative body set up by a State to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However, they operate and function independently from government. While their specific mandate may vary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they help bridge the 'protection gap' between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of the State. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights ombudsman institutions, Hybrid institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centres and multiple institutions. An Independent NHRI is an institution with 'A level' accreditation status as benchmarked against the United Nations Paris Principles, which were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993.1 The process of accreditation is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the ICC. There are three possible types of accreditation: A: Compliance with Paris Principles B: Observer Status ' Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles Accreditation by the ICC entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights systems. Method of computation The indicator is computed as the accreditation classification, namely A, B or C of the NHRI.","indicator_name":"Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles","indicator_sort_order":"16-0a-01","indicator_variable":null,"international_and_national_references":null,"layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"","national_geographical_coverage":"United States","periodicity":null,"permalink":"/16-a-1/","published":false,"rationale_interpretation":"This indicator measures the global continual efforts of countries in setting up independent national institutions, through international cooperation, to promote inclusive, peaceful and accountable societies. The creation and fosterage of a NHRI indicates a State's commitment to promote and protect the human rights provided in international human rights instruments. Compliance with the Paris Principles vest NHRIs with a broad mandate, competence and power to investigate, report on the national human rights situation, and publicise human rights through information and education. While NHRIs are essentially state funded, they are to maintain independence and pluralism. When vested with a quasi-judicial competence, NHRIs handle complaints and assist victims in taking their cases to courts making them an essential component in the national human rights protection system. These fundamental functions that NHRIs play and their increasing participation in the international human rights fora make them important actors in the improvement of the human rights situation, including the elimination of discriminatory laws and the promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws \nAt the national level reporting, the better the accreditation classification of the NHRI reflects that it is credible, legitimate, relevant and effective in promoting human rights at the national level.","reporting_status":"notstarted","scheduled_update_by_SDG_team":null,"scheduled_update_by_national_source":null,"sdg_goal":16,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":null,"source_agency_staff_name_1":null,"source_agency_survey_dataset_1":null,"source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":null,"source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":null,"target":"Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime.","target_id":"16.a","time_period":null,"title":"Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles","un_custodial_agency":"OHCHR","un_designated_tier":"1","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""},"9-c-1":{"actual_indicator_available":"Percentage of the U.S. population covered by at least a 3G mobile network.

It is recognized that the suggested indicator does not cater to all dimensions of the target, but finding one indicator that would do so seems unviable, certainly over the short-medium term. \nThere is the added challenge that the concept \"sustainable tourism\" is mainly a policy construct and not defined nor part of an established or internationally conceptual/statistical framework at this point. Even though UNWTO together with a number of countries, UNSD and OECD, and counting on the support of the UNCEEA are putting put in motion an initiative towards developing the measurement of the relationship between tourism and sustainability, notably through linking SEEA and TSA, it seems that the production of internationally comparable data on (something that could approximate for) \"sustainable tourism\" in a significant number of countries still has some years to go. \nFor the meantime, the suggested indicator (in its two parts, on tourism related GDP and jobs) seems to be a sensible approximation because (a) it is a good conceptual fit to some key dimensions of the target (b) it stems from a systems approach and is based on sound internationally agreed methodology, and (c) there is a significant number of countries already producing data for this indicator. In addition, the suggested indicator (tourism related GDP and jobs) is in line with Goal 8's general focus on economic growth and employment. \nFinally, the TDGDP/GDP part of this indicator can complement Target 14.7's indicator: \"Fisheries as a % of GDP\" in order to cater to tourism dimension of this target. \n\n Interpretation \n Target 8.9 has several dimensions; this caters to the dimension: tourism; promote [...] tourism. The value of the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative) increases or decreases in it, could indicate the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at national level and the level of sub-national regions as it gives the only credible measure of the economic contribution of tourism, which can be compared to GDP contributions of other economic activities.

Some of these data are already collected while others need further development. For example, UN Women routinely collects data on women Heads of State and Government; the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) regularly collects data on the proportion of women ministers and in parliaments; indicators on women in law enforcement are also readily available; and ILO regularly publishes data on women managers using data from national labour force surveys. Data on women's political participation at the local level have not been as systematically collected at the global level. Measuring women's participation in local government is important, however, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is, seats) available to women candidates at this level. To measure women's representation in local governments, methodologies and standards are currently being developed by UN Women and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG).","indicator_name":"Proportion of women in managerial positions","indicator_variable":"proportion_women_managerial","periodicity":"Yearly","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"Women participate in politics and decision-making at all levels, in different functions and across all spheres.
